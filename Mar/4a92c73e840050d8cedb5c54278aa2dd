The knobs, buttons and switches have also been regrouped for easier, more intuitive usage.There is cabin space aplenty to comfortably host five biggies and the luggage space is could accommodate all the accessories for a fashion model photo shoot.DrivabilityHowever, where the F-Sport impresses most is on the road where it dishes up a surprisingly spirited ride, thanks to AWD configuration, six-speed auto transmission and lively turbo-charged 2.0-litre engine which kicks out 175kw and 350NM to deliver 0-100km/h in 7.1 seconds.What is surprising is this SUVâ€™s eagerness to gallop, even in standard mode, but now the driver has the option of selecting Sport, Sport+ or the newly-added Custom modes. Sport + can also be used to increase dampening for more dynamic cling.This sporty Lexus is pure pleasure to pilot along a stretch of snaking country road devoid of traffic. It clings to the tar with tenacity, and the car displays little inclination towards body lean when being hustled through the twisties.Peace of mind features include a comprehensive occupant safety net of ABS, EBD with Brake Assist, Traction Control and (on our test model) Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert.Overall, this particular Lexus is refreshingly different from the rest of the rather bland box-shaped SUV herd. The F-Sport we piloted wears a price tag of R789,700 which includes a four-year/100,000km warranty and a full maintenance plan for the same period.
