I did a search on Trematon Drive and found over a seven year period there were no resales. I also picked up an instance where a property in Hollander Crescent which sold in 2012 for R1.8m just a year later fetched R3.65m, which could be a home that was purchased in poor condition, renovated and then resold. There are good opportunities if you can pick up a dilapidated property and restore it.”Says Reynolds: “Properties in Durban have held their value over the years, with areas such as Durban North, for example, experiencing sound price appreciation of 7% year-on-year. In upper Durban North, where homes sell for between R5m and R10m, coveted addresses include Westminster Place and Monteith Place.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1511/321158-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cape Town launches own Monopoly board game" width="120" height="120">Cape Town launches own Monopoly board gameCape Town's very own Monopoly board game was revealed at the V&A Waterfront last week...18 Nov 2015More affordable than Cape TownAdds Burger: “When compared to Cape Town, Durban’s climate sets it apart – winter doesn’t even feel like winter. Property prices are still much more affordable when compared with Cape Town, while Johannesburg does not have the lifestyle appeal of Durban, and of course no beaches, so many Gauteng families are choosing to relocate for these reasons.“The Durban Monopoly board game is also a plus for local residents as it’s a clever way of making the game more relevant for anyone who loves this city. It will certainly re-ignite many Monopoly players to go out and buy this new version for a fun and personal gaming experience.”Reynolds adds that it is further positive endorsement for a city that has previously been underestimated and which is now coming into its own. “With the recent surge of interest in Durban from a tourism perspective, and just based on its dream climate and lifestyle offering – including a world-renowned promenade and all the amenities one could wish for, it’s the perfect time for Durban to gain further recognition. It has a great range and selection of residential options, which makes it ideal for home buyers. Not for nothing has it been ranked top city in South Africa for its quality of life (Mercer Index) for the past three consecutive years.”
