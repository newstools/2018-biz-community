(Image Supplied)Meeting high heat demand and energy costs, saving waterThe installation consists of 30 innovative PowerCollectors, a unique technology which combines generation of thermal (T) energy with the photovoltaic (PV) generation of electricity and produces one of the highest energy yields ever measured. When compared to traditional solar panels, the PowerCollector produces both electricity and hot water output up to 70°C and delivers three times more energy on the same surface area. In addition to the renewable energy produced on the roof of the hotel, the installation also saves 79,000 litres of water per year by reducing energy used from the grid. This is because for every kWh electricity bought from the South African power utility company Eskom uses 1.45 litres of water to produce. This is significant since water saving is a fundamental factor to any resident or business located in Cape Town, due to the city’s current water crisis. The energy produced in conjunction with the reduced demand from the grid will provide electricity and heat throughout the hotel. Over a 20-year period, this installation will save the hotel approximately €250,000.“In the hospitality industry, there is a high heat demand and energy cost, it was with this in mind, and our unwavering responsible business mindset that installing the 30 PowerCollectors, maximising our small rooftop made absolute sense. With the location of our hotel, our rooftop is also the perfect location to absorb as much sun as possible and generate three times more energy,” said Jim Schleich, general manager of Park Inn by Radisson Cape Town Foreshore. “We are thrilled that the installation will not only be saving electricity but will also have a significant water saving, which adds to our extensive water-saving initiatives, as we strive to avoid Day Zero in the region.” #RenewableEnergy #energytransition We are installing the PowerCollector at @parkinn Foreshore in Cape Town pic.twitter.com/uz2wAI3OGe— Solarus Sunpower (@SolarusSunpower) February 23, 2018Responsible businessInge Huijbrechts, global vice president, responsible business, Radisson Hotel Group said: “As a responsible business leader, we aim to align with the global targets of the COP21 Paris Climate Agreement and significantly reduce our hotels’ carbon footprint. As part of our Think Planet pillar in our responsible business strategy, one of the areas we are focusing on is increasing the number of Radisson Group hotels making use of renewable energy. Renewable energy has immense untapped potential, even in city centres and business districts, as this innovative project at our Park Inn by Radisson Foreshore hotel proves. One of the key steps in our strategy is to partner with innovative companies such as Solarus who strive to provide a clean, renewable alternative energy source, actively diverting the burgeoning energy demand from CO2-intensive sources and thereby helping to combat climate change.”Henning Brand, development director for Solarus in South Africa said: “The sun is very generous in South Africa and makes for an attractive business case. It makes absolute sense to harvest the free energy instead of using fossil fuel based sources. As a certified B (benefit) corporation, Solarus wishes to compliment the Think Planet Responsible Business Strategy by Radisson Hotel Group. As businesses, we have to use our influence in the world as a force for good, and that is exactly what the Park Inn by Radisson, Cape Town Foreshore has done by example.”
