The election of Cyril Ramaphosa as president of the ANC and of SA has been a very positive development for country, economy and property market.Upgraded economic outlookAction around state capture, the prosecution of Jacob Zuma and the cabinet shuffle to return confidence to major sectors of government have all been well received by the market, business and the ratings agencies. Moody’s has for example just announced that it is keeping SA’s sovereign credit rating at investment grade and upgraded the economic outlook to positive.Currently, inflation is at around 4% which is within the Reserve Bank’s target range of 3-6%. The rand also continues to perform well although it is always subject to a degree of volatility.These developments are good news for the property market. While the outlook for 2018 is much better than last year, it remains largely a buyers’ market for the time being and sellers need to maintain a more conservative approach to their price expectations.On the upside, the last year has seen lots of new stock come onto the market and it is an excellent time to buy property, especially if it is your primary home. Prices have remained fairly flat over the last 12-18 months as the market took a breather and there are many motivated sellers. This interest rate cut is a great incentive for hesitant buyers and there is no reason to wait.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434943-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cape Town residential property market ranked world's second top-performing market" width="120" height="120">Cape Town residential property market ranked world's second top-performing marketAccording to the Knight Frank 2018 Wealth Report's Prime International Residential Index (PIRI 100), Cape Town grew by 19.9% between 2016-2017...1 day agoSA property remains an excellent investment and we continue seeing stand-out performances.
