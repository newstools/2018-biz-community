Tower will be represented on TPF International’s board through Edwards, who will be a non-executive director. Tower’s regional representative in Croatia, Ivan Bozac, will be the company’s CEO.Strengthening Tower’s balance sheet“The establishment of TPF International will strengthen Tower’s balance sheet (through the Oryx investment detailed below) whilst providing us with the ability to grow our earnings from our Croatian investments,” says Edwards.“Tower is also very pleased to announce that Oryx Properties Limited, a property loan stock company listed on the Namibian Stock Exchange with a diverse property portfolio valued at approximately $N2.3bn (R2.3bn), has committed to invest R300m in TPF International through, a combination of, the acquisition of TPF International shares from Tower and a subscription for shares in TPF International.”Edwards advises that TPF International will use the proceeds from the share subscription to fund yield enhancing acquisitions, while Tower intends to use the proceeds from the share sale to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing both euro and ZAR debt.
