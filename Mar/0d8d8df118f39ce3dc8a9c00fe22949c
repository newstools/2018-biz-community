This is an overwhelming achievement for the Indian Spice team to be recognised for their work in the Indian diaspora network,” says editor and founder Naufal Khan. “Our brand name is incomparable in the market in SA, the African continent and internationally.” A feature of the adjudication was voting by the website’s loyal fans. Khan and his team put out requests on Facebook and using their video sensation Adventures of 9Boy to drum up support from readers. The readers had responded positively acknowledging the Indian Spice brand and ensuring that the Indian lifestyle platform had a voice in the competition. “We are glad to be recognised by Blog Awards, it recognises something about bespoke content for a strong community,” says Derek Abdinor, business partner in Indian Spice. “Our operations, though, extend through many things from event management to investigative journalism. As part of the ACME network we make this unique audience available to interested brands.” In the Best Entertainment category, Indian Spice was runner-up to mommy-blogger Deep In The Motherhood. This was the first time Indian Spice entered into a industry market. The power of a blog has superseded traditional websites in the past decade in performance, presence and information propagation. Indian Spice now competes with larger networks in ranking and news dissemination on Google and organically reaches a greater diaspora network over and above the South African Indian community. Another partner website that took top position was for Best LGBT Blog was news website Mambaonline.com. "While Mambaonline is not a blog in the traditional sense, and is more of a news site for the LGBT community, we're very honoured to be recognised as the best LGBT blog in SA," says Mambaonline.com editor Luiz De Barros. "Any recognition of LGBT media and voices is welcome. We hope this inspires others in our community to go online and share their experiences and insights."
