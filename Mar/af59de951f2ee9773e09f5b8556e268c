We look forward to having a fruitful engagement with Kia.”Hyundai Motor, Kia’s sister company, will also be providing its vehicles to UN. The contract between Kia (including Hyundai) and the UN equates to approximately $7m over the next three years, with the possibility of a two-year extension. Hyundai Mobis, part of Hyundai Motor Group, will also be providing automotive parts to the UN.
