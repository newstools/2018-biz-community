Van den Barselaar provides the following tips for maximising your commute:  Upskill - Entertaining and educational podcasts have become a popular way to pass the time. So why not use these to upskill?  Choose one that will give you something to think about, that is relevant to your work experience or something you would like to add as a personal or professional skill.   Manage your stress - Meditation apps provide a simple way for you to process your stress and prepare for the day. Though you can't close your eyes while driving, you can clear your head, think through your plans for the day, and brainstorm ways to manage your time.  “High levels of stress and anxiety plague millions of people worldwide, and can lead to reduced concentration and productivity. Taking time out in the mornings to focus on relaxation can assist in ensuring you do not feel overwhelmed during the work day,” says van den Barselaar.   Prepare for an important conversation - Perhaps you have been putting off a conversation with your boss about your career? Are you giving an important presentation at work?  “Your commute is the perfect time to rehearse and prepare, to ensure you feel confident,” says van den Barselaar. Practice your key talking points out loud, think through the questions you might receive and how you would respond.  Catch up on emails – For those who are not sitting in the driver's seat, the commute to work is a great time to work on tasks that may not require deep concentration. Rather than burning the first hour of your day reading through emails at the office, establish a discipline of doing this during your commute. It will save you time, and you can flag those emails that require immediate action when you arrive at the office.  Plan your day – If you haven't got a handle on your calendar yet, or the projects you need to accomplish, your commute to the office is the perfect time to plan out your day.  “Create a to do list or if you have a voice-activated tool like Siri on your phone, have it record your thoughts on where you'll spend your time,” says van den Barselaar. When you get to the office, you can write your tasks on your daily calendar.   Get some exercise - If you work a reasonable distance from your home, consider this the perfect time for your daily workout. Whether you're biking or walking - exercising on your way to work will help reduce stress, burn calories and get your mind sharp for the day.   Network - Do you commute to work with peers? If so, van den Barselaar points out that this is the perfect time to build cross-functional relationships that can assist in your career development. Avoid slipping into a habit of office gossip, and instead use the time to learn about other departments within the business, discuss best practices and share ideas. When you commute with people from other companies, you never know when you might learn about worthwhile networking events or possible job opportunities outside your organisation.“There is no reason commuting has to be unproductive. Maximise your time on the road by developing your professional skills, building relationships or clearing your mind,” van den Barselaar concludes.
