The rest was covered mostly by renewables."The significant growth in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 tells us that current efforts to combat climate change are far from sufficient," IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement."For example, there has been a dramatic slowdown in the rate of improvement in global energy efficiency as policymakers have put less focus in this area," he said.But the overall increase in CO2 emissions masked major improvements in some individual countries, including the United States, a big polluter. In fact, the US saw the biggest drop in emissions, helped by a higher deployment of renewables. Emissions also declined in Britain, Mexico and Japan, the IEA said.The 29-nation IEA provides analysis on global energy markets and advocates policies enhancing the reliability, affordability and sustainability of energy.Source: AFP
