"A private investor cannot finance the railway we want alone," the head of state was quoted as saying, describing Bollore's offer as "lower-end".<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432112-120x120.jpg?2" alt="More than 30 global firms want to supply Tanzania with electric trains" width="120" height="120">More than 30 global firms want to supply Tanzania with electric trainsThe government has reportedly started screening more than 30 global firms which applied for contracts to supply electric trains to ply the standard gauge railway (SGR) line of which construction just started...By Sylivester Domasa 6 Mar 2018"China has the necessary financial means" to support work estimated to cost around $4bn (€3.3bn), said Talon. "China has demonstrated its technical know-how" to build infrastructure in Africa, added the president, who rarely speaks to the media. Ongoing sagaTalon's remarks are the latest twist in a saga that has been going on for years. In 2008, Benin and Niger launched a bid to manage the construction and management of a 740-kilometre (462-mile) railway network linking Cotonou and Niamey. The bid was won by Petrolin, a company owned by Beninese businessman Samuel Dossou, but was handed over by the government in 2013 to the Bollore group through Benirail, a company representing a public-private partnership. However last October, a Benin judge ruled that Petrolin should have had the contract and dismissed Bollore.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/413747-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo by Kholodnitskiy Maksim on Unsplash" width="120" height="120">Nigeria needs $16bn to construct, modernise rail linesThe Nigerian government needs about $16 billion to construct and modernise major rail lines, an official said...By Sani Tukur 9 Oct 2017After years in court and months of negotiations, the project remains at a standstill, strangling growth in the country of 10 million inhabitants whose economy depends on the distribution of goods from its port. No formal notice yetPetrolin representatives said that despite Talon's statement they have not been given formal notice to withdraw."The withdrawal of Petrolin will be the result of negotiations between Benin and Niger," said Petrolin spokeswoman Claudine Affiavi Prudencio. "This option (the withdrawal of the project) is not yet formally notified to the Petrolin group" and "at this moment the group hasn't failed", said a source close to the Beninese businessman contacted by AFP.But a source at the presidency said that the onus was now on the companies to show they can move forward on the project. "Heads of state (Benin and Niger) have tried to bring them together (Petrolin and Bollore) without success," a presidency source told AFP. "It would be up to them to show them that they can agree to carry a convincing project," he said. There was no immediate comment from the Bollore group when contacted by AFP.Source: AFP
