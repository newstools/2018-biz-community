Three dimensions have been added to the festival. These new activities have been created to increase consumerâ€™s interaction and enjoyment with wine and food, and to increase wine education in a fun way. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433024-625x375.jpg" alt="Wine show returns to Khayelitsha" width="625" height="375">Attendees will be accommodated on the large lawns surrounding the oval and huge marquees will be constructed for the food and wine stalls, which attendees may visit while listening to live music by well-known artists and DJs.The Khayelitsha Wine Show is not only a lifestyle event and will be able to create about 35 temporary jobs through the event for car guards, event assistants, and hostesses. Local businesses will also have also the opportunity to be part of the event, that forms part of the township economy development that the organisers are involved in.To book your wine/food/lifestyle exhibition stand at the Khayelitsha Wine Show, contact Vuyani 083 262 3340 or email Vuyani.blom@yahoo.combRev('brev-71929483-a30a-4245-be9c-b6271a278cc6', '>a/\<moc.oohay@molb.inayuV>"moc.oohay;46#&molb.inayuV:otliam"=ferh a<').
