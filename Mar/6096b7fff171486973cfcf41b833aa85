Back in Women’s Month, communication specialist Jana Leonard explained the importance of hands-on experience to succeed in this typically-female field and how she juggles all her responsibilities. It’s certainly not easy.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/406047-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Jana Leonard.

It takes consistency, patience, mutual respect and creative thinking – it requires a lot of hustling!<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434636.jpg" alt="Jana Leonard.

For example, Leonard shares the following four PR-media relationship to-dos. Yes, they sound obvious, but you’d be surprised how many on both sides forget one or more of these points: Be kind and respectful at all timesDeliver on your promisesCommunicate and follow upBe honest and authentic – in your relationships, in your content and in your pitchesHere, Leonard shares the context of the current PR industry, what attendees can expect from the various speakers, and what else the industry can do to boost the SA PR industry’s local knowledge base – both the newbies lacking experience and the older set that are set in their ways. The answer is also simple, as you’ll see!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Talk us through the context of the current PR industry and how you came up with the idea behind the PR Hustle.The PR industry has changed in the last few years with the rapid growth of digital, social media and the rise of influencers, resulting in a huge influx of content that needs to be shared on a daily basis to keep readers interested and engaged.This has challenged PR professionals to really think about the reader and create pitches that are both informative and add value. Doing so takes a lot of creative thinking and hustling from both parties. Just as the industry itself is moving with the digital times, the way in which PR professionals pitch and create content needs to change.In addition to this, it has become apparent to me that due to the digitally driven age we find ourselves in, we don’t always get to meet fellow PR professionals and the members of the media we spend so much time talking to via email and phone. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434634.jpg" alt="The PR Hustle...

In addition – this may be one of the most important drivers for the PR Hustle – I would love for like-minded industry-driven individuals to connect with each other offline growing the industry, one networking event at a time. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Fantastic. What will members of the media learn from their colleagues in the PR industry? Not only will The PR Hustle allow journalists to meet and mingle with fellow journalists, freelancers and PR professionals, but they will also get insight into pitching content and ideas themselves.Freelancers may pitch stories to publications for their next project, or journalists would pitch ideas to their editors – the PR Hustle’s various event speakers will aim to assist with this..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What else can the industry do to boost the SA PR industry’s local knowledge base – both the newbies lacking experience and the older set that are set in their ways? Network, network, network! I personally believe that learning from each other, is the best way to gain knowledge and grow within your chosen industry. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Definitely. PR and the media as sometimes seen as ‘the dark side divide’, as there’s so much misunderstanding from both sides of the fence. How does it benefit those in PR to have worked in the media industry, and vice versa, in terms of what this experience brings to your skillset and how you view the ‘other side’. From a PR perspective, I believe the ability to create content on behalf of your clients, while adding value to the readers, is your biggest trait. Understanding a target market and readership is vital when it comes to PR and media. I do believe the two industries are very aligned, and working together is where the magic happens!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That’s for sure! What do you have planned for the talks so far? What can attendees expect to learn from the various speakers? I am so excited for the first The PR Hustle and cannot wait to meet everyone!
