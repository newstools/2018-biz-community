This year’s theme was centred around ‘Designing Tomorrow’s Fashionpreneurs’. The fashion Industry is one of the most coveted in the world. So, why do so few fashion students in South Africa successfully break into, or innovate a sustainable career, in the diverse world that is the apparel business?Golden opportunityThe global fashion industry is worth $3tn, yet sub-Saharan Africa accounts for less than 1% of this…. A staggering statistic considering the apparel and textile industry has the ability to create numerous income opportunities and positively advance the country’s fiscal and social economy. (Even President Ramaphosa mentioned the sector and its potential in his State of the Nation Address in February). South Africa’s youth unemployment rate is currently one of the highest in the world – at a frightening 52.2%* – and as everyone needs to be clothed, it represents a golden opportunity for not only designers, but pattern cutters, textile developers, trim specialists, embroiderers, merchandisers, writers and so many more, to put their best fashion foot forward. What once was a thriving contributor to our economy is poised again to make a cutting comeback – modern, sleek, and more professional, better able to endure and evolve.New millennium territory“But first we need to arm the next wave of fashionpreneurs, with the knowledge and skills to make it, not only in the competitive fashion world but in business,” says Wayne van der Rheede, spokesperson for Wear SA. “The 2018 Wear SA Fashioning the Future Workshop will seek to kickstart this process by presenting a facilitated panel discussion and mentoring forum for fashion college students and budding fashionpreneurs. It is vital that we bridge this gap as soon as possible...”The workshop tackled the ‘new millennium’ territory and fashion philosophy around the business of fashion and why fashion landmines destroy potential, talent and success. Industry experts and iconic fashionpreneurs anchored the panel, providing first-hand insight, advice and opinions around why there is such tremendous designer talent in South Africa, but few go on to develop long-term profitable businesses. Panellists included:Herman Pillay – managing director of TCI ApparelTamsyn Johannisen – designer of the brands, Democracy of Denim and Wear SAAnnette De Wet – founder and editor of online magazine, MagentaSiya Beyile – founder of online platform for men's fashion and lifestyle, The Threaded ManBokang Lehabe – director and head designer at Bookha Creations.*statistics as per Trading Economics and reflect the period to second quarter 2017.
