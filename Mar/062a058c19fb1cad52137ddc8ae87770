This may be an option that needs to be explored further to address the directive given by the President,” the department said.The department added that it has seen lots of interest and good will from the public in terms of wanting to assist in providing solutions to the challenges faced by the sector.“We will begin by conducting an audit of sanitation facilities at schools within a month and develop an emergency plan which will be sent to the President and National Treasury for consideration. Only then will it be possible to advise stakeholders and business on how they can get involved and assist.“It will assist our country now and in future to look for solutions to these complex challenges, and ensure every child is able to go to school in a safe and conducive environment.”
