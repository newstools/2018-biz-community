Bakker: We attribute our students’ success to their immense commitment to their field of study. The students who performed well in the 2017 Loeries student category approached projects in a professional manner. Lots of research was conducted leading up to the execution and experimentation was implemented throughout.Koetje: The successes can be attributed to the students' commitment and hard work. Additionally, they have the opportunity to interact with multiple encouraging lecturers, who push them beyond what they thought was possible as well as industry professionals to expand their skill set and approach to their work.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434194.jpg" alt="Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434195.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="787" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434196.jpg" alt="Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434197.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="787" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434198.jpg" alt="Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434199.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="3543" data-lheight="2362" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434200.jpg" alt="Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434201.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="838" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434202.jpg" alt="Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434203.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="787" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434204.jpg" alt="Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered species" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434205.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="3543" data-lheight="2362" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Matthew Tager's Fiction: The endangered speciesZulu: I genuinely attribute my success to years of hard work and training at the Open Window Institute. If it was not for the guidance received from my lecturers throughout my studies, I would not have gotten to the point that I am at in my creative journey. Furthermore, the inspiration of the city I live in, the people within it as well as my own thirst to 'hustle' helped me to create work that I’m proud of.Tager: I would attribute my success in 2017 to my self-determination and willingness to greater my skills and learn from both my peers and mentors. The year 2017 afforded me the opportunity to explore both my personal life and design career, both critically and expressively, in order to do the best and excel at every opportunity that presented itself to me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What plans are already underway to better your ranking in 2018? Bakker: The aim for 2018 is to maintain a sense of enthusiasm within our students. Students will be encouraged to treat project briefs as if they are real industry briefs that require thorough conceptualisation and planning. Students will also be further encouraged to focus on the final crafting or finishes of their projects, in order to excel. Hopefully, this will influence our ranking for 2018.Koetje: Our main focus is on providing students with content and projects that are relevant and innovative, with a strong conceptual overtone and a lot of creative freedom, not on creating briefs to fit into award- or competition criteria. This has brought about some amazing results that stretch beyond the scope of awards and competitions..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does the 2017 Loeries flock differ from your haul the previous year? Bakker: The conceptual focus and stylistic exploration proved to be more diverse. Students approached projects in a more experimental manner and took more risks with projects.Koetje: The 2017 flock is still, as always, a talented and committed bunch. Students, however, do push more boundaries, both visually and conceptually, every year..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us who you personally admire in the industry. Bakker: It’s difficult to limit my admiration of a representative in the industry to one specific person. Locally, there is such a great diversity of phenomenal talent in all creative sectors. I think rather than identifying specific individuals, it’s also worth specifically highlighting the entrepreneurial spirit of creatives operating within the industry. Many have managed to establish their own niche for them to operate in. Cape Town-based Studio Muti is, however, one that stands out as they consistently manage to create high-level work. In terms of up-and-coming talent, I enjoy the work of Adam Black.Koetje: Garth Walker is certainly an inspiration due to his approach and the risks he takes, but mostly for his typography. Then, I admire any designers, newcomers or established mentors that design for social impact and change.Zulu: After being at the Open Window Institute for a total of four years and completing my honours degree in visual communication, I have mustered the confidence to start my own company called Zuluvisual, through which I do freelance illustration and design for various clients. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434165.jpg" alt="Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434166.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1165" data-lheight="827" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434168.jpg" alt="Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434169.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="787" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434171.jpg" alt="Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434172.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="838" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434174.jpg" alt="Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434175.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="838" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434177.jpg" alt="Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434182.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1181" data-lheight="838" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434184.jpg" alt="Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1803/434185.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1252" data-lheight="827" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Zinhle Zulu's Holy Hustle.I am really enjoying it. Navigating the growing creative industry in this country can be tough, however, there are creatives that inspire me, like Karabo Poppy Moletsane. Her work ethic and initiative is what I admire about her, aside from her always-amazing illustrations. She really is paving the way for young illustrators like myself. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1604/337994-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Karabo Poppy Moletsane" width="120" height="120">Karabo Moletsane and Cotton On team up to take designs globalSouth Africa has recently seen a massive rejuvenation of young, talented illustrators who are changing their industry with fresh designs.

His illustration style and the many platforms that he has managed to get his work onto makes for an eye-opening experience of where my own work could be someday... soon.Tager: I admire Elani Botha as a mentor for my design career – her willingness to share ideas, lend a helping hand and expanding on concepts through great conversation has inspired me to provide the same influence to others, where and when I can.As an up-and-coming artist, I am in awe of the work that my peer, Zinhle Zulu, produces both conceptually and aesthetically. Her subject matter and application in her work translates clearly in a flawless manner tackling local ideas, something very important for both the current epoch of South African society and creative industry.That’s for sure.
