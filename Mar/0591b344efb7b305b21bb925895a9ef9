“This is the definitive directory of home improvement and lifestyle products and providers,” says Estelle Venter, product development director of Homemakers Media Holdings.“The Mobi magazine will also have editorial content – something totally new to the market. This is because we want to serve homeowners with advice and news on trends as well.”She says the innovation and functionality of the Mobi magazine takes Homemakers another giant leap forward.“The Mobi magazine is very easy to use and finding information for specific services or products is very simple. The latest version of South Arica’s favourite monthly home improvement directory will now be available on your smart phone.“It has been designed for easy and intuitive use and the reader will be able to download the Mobi magazine, follow links, search for suppliers, share the magazine with friends, send emails and even phone advertisers without having to close the magazine.“When the original Homemakers Digest was launched in 1984 – later renamed to Homemakers Fair – we became the ultimate lead generator to our advertisers. We have lead the market for many years and Homemakers Mobi is the next step in in providing our advertisers with an integrated online and offline advertising opportunity – and our readers with an easy-to-use source of suppliers.“We are not replacing the printed version of the magazine, we are merely extending our reach – and the reach of our advertisers. The Mobi version will more than make up for the areas where we cannot distribute the printed magazine anymore.”She says there are now large areas that have changed to gated and boomed communities.“It has become increasingly difficult, and in some areas impossible, to distribute to boomed and gated areas, security complexes and estates. Not only will the Mobi version now reach those homeowners, we are also extending our reach with the database of 140,000.” About HomemakersOver the past three decades, Homemakers has developed a unique bouquet of media opportunities, bringing advertisers and consumers together.
