However, Gauteng employers report an improvement of six percentage points, while outlooks for Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal remain relatively stable.“As the Western Cape province continues to struggle under a debilitating drought, businesses are making large investments in securing water supply. It was recently reported that many firms in the province have already invested heavily in greywater systems, rainwater harvesting, boreholes and equipment to reduce water use. This is more than likely leading to the planned uptake in hiring in the province, as employment opportunities are being created through the provision of goods and services for alternative water supplies and saving,” explains Van den Barselaar.
