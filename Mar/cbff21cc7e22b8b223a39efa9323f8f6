Already, 201 qualifications were found to be misrepresented.He said he hopes SAQA will be able to move permanently to the digital space.“Going digital in this way puts SAQA at the forefront of the fourth Industrial Revolution, which embraces digitisation and its benefits. “This development builds on the efforts SAQA has made to ensure quicker and more efficient evaluation of foreign qualifications through the establishment of the African Qualifications Verification Network in 2016, as well as the Southern African Development Community Qualifications Verification Network in 2017, and SAQA’s ongoing work with members of the Groningen Declaration Network,” Samuels said.SAQA asked stakeholders and recipients of the digital seals and certificates to share their experiences and ideas in order to help the authority move into the digital era.Feedback can be forwarded to www.saqa.org.za or saqainfo@saqa.org.zabRev('brev-299a0ed3-9c3d-4d24-8c73-dce0b190ac95', '>a/\<az.gro.aqas@ofniaqas>"az.gro.aqas;46#&ofniaqas:otliam"=ferh a<'), or call +27 (0)12 431 5000.
