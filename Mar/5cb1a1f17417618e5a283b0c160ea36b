The issue is that there was lack of political will and decisiveness to bring the government and business negotiators to account," he said.President Cyril Ramaphosa promised the nation during his state of the nation address in February that the national minimum wage would come into effect on 1 May.Cosatu parliamentary coordinator Matthew Parks said the National Minimum Wage Bill, along with the Labour Relations Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill before the committee would have been easy targets for court action had more time not been allocated for the legislative process."We are happy with the extra time " If it is rushed, then Parliament will not have the time to make the changes we have been calling for."There was a gap that we felt if left untouched would have defied the point of the national minimum wage."Coleman presented the first public submission to the labour committee on Thursday, where he informed MPs about the flaws in the wage bill.These included a proposal to phase out sectoral determinations in three years, replacing them with bargaining councils and failure to include a resolution made at Nedlac to insert a provision stating that the minimum wage commission would implement annual increases to the R20 per hour rate, to compensate workers for inflation.Source: Business Day
