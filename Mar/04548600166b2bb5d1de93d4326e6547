The language is still shocking -  even I need to get my head around it and it had me, a technologist intimidated and baffled, so the average person must have felt even more so.” This was technical arrogance, where people hid behind jargon to sound more important, but all that did was to slow adoption and breed distrust, he says. “While cryptocurrency is the most quoted use case for blockchain, and there has been a lot of hype around this. There are an amazing and huge amount of blockchain-based technologies and services solving the needs of identity, privacy and finances.”  While it all began with Bitcoin, it is not cryptocurrency, but the technology beneath it that is valuable. What it can do is what is of interest today and that has led to the interest in the technology growing.  Tipping pointThe adoption of blockchain is reaching a tipping point. “If in 10 years’ time it is not an entrenched technology, then I would, if I wore one, eat my hat," he says.
