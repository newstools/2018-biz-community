Postmedia also rejected accusations of wrongdoing."Postmedia is strongly of the view that there has been no contravention of the Competition Act with respect to this matter," it said.The November deal saw Postmedia, which owns dailies in most major Canadian cities including the National Post, acquire 22 weekly papers as well as two free dailies, and immediately put all but one of them on the chopping block.Torstar – which publishes Canada's largest circulation daily, the Toronto Star, and its subsidiary Metroland – acquired 15 weekly and small-town daily newspapers mostly in Ontario, as well as free dailies 24 Hours Toronto and 24 Hours Vancouver.Metroland, citing falling advertising revenues, also shuttered three daily and eight community publications.The deal was called "a deathblow to local news coverage" by the union representing media workers, while Ottawa earmarked Can$50 million for struggling local news in last month's federal budget.
