This open structure and the tyre's smart tread design absorbs and circulates moisture and water from the road surface, allowing photosynthesis to occur and therefore releasing oxygen into the air.  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433512-625x325.jpg?2" alt="#GIMS2018: Goodyear moving tyres to the next level" width="625" height="325">The company also offered a sneak peek of its EfficientGrip Performance with Electric Drive Technology, a prototype tyre for the growing electric vehicle market that will be on the road by 2019 in Europe.Goodyear testing reportedly reveals that traditional tyres can wear out up to 30% faster on electric vehicles due to the powerful, instant torque from electric motors and the additional vehicle weight from heavy battery packs.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433513-625x325.jpg?1" alt="#GIMS2018: Goodyear moving tyres to the next level" width="625" height="325">“The combination of increasing regulations to reduce emissions, the desire to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and rapid gains in battery technology is creating an ideal environment for electric vehicles,” said Delaney. “We are working with automakers to introduce our Electric Drive Technology next year designed to address the unique performance requirements of this growing vehicle segment.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432481-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mazda's Vision Coupe" width="120" height="120">#GIMS2018: Concept Car of the Year goes to MazdaThis year's Geneva International Motor Show saw Mazda's Vision Coupe win the Concept Car of the Year title at the Car Design Night Geneva...By Ilse van den Berg 8 Mar 2018In addition to tyre durability requirements, automakers are pressing for enhanced rolling resistance on electric vehicles. Increasing range is a high priority for consumers due to an underdeveloped electric recharging infrastructure in most countries. Quiet and comfort from tyres is another consideration as, at low speeds, electric vehicles generate as little as half the amount of noise as traditional vehicles.
