This year’s entrants included 132 cities in 23 countries.The challenge, which is now held every two years, recognises cities for developing infrastructure, housing, transport, and mobility solutions to power the global transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.Sustainable transport and mobilityThe 2017-2018 competition puts extra emphasis on sustainable transport and mobility – a major environmental challenge for cities around the globe, with almost one-quarter of carbon emissions derived from transportation. As it is a challenge, this is also an opportunity for cities to capitalise on sustainable solutions and positive synergies to meet urban lifestyles and mobility demands, while improving quality of life, without exhausting our planet’s ecological capacity.“We are delighted that Cape Town, Johannesburg and eThekwini have been selected as finalists. These cities should be commended for their efforts. Cities are powerful change makers and these three cities have the ability to contribute towards South Africa meeting its carbon emissions commitments under the Paris Agreement,” commented Louise Scholtz, Urban Futures programme manager for WWF South Africa’s Policy and Futures Unit.
