Travelstart Live and its expert agents are now integrated with the website and apps rather than competing with digital channels as a standalone service."Travelstart will use analytics to automatically prompt customers to Travelstart Live where they will be offered expert support. In addition, Travelstart will work closely with SafariNow.com to optimise their accommodation offering.The importance of omnichannel"Travelstart Live is a new channel to engage customers where our digital platforms do not fit their shopping behaviour.“We recognise the importance of omnichannel in offering our customers the right platform depending on their comfort with technology and the type of trip they wish to book. In doing this, we are closing the gap that exists between human support and e-commerce and giving customers the freedom to interact with us on their terms,” said Balme.Customers can view a product online, and either complete their booking online or interact with experienced travel consultants via Travelstart Live to get more information, expert advice and book.
