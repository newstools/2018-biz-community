It is said to be the biggest-selling “urban crossover” in Europe and is doing well in South Africa, despite the fact it is competing in a difficult market and in a segment with plenty of players.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432435.jpg" alt="The new Nissan Qashqai conquers the city" width="120" height="120">The new Nissan Qashqai conquers the cityEurope's best-selling urban crossover, the Nissan Qashqai, has had a facelift. Designed for the city, it comes with a host of Nissan Intelligent Mobility features, making life in the city so much easier; hence the hashtag #Cityproof...Issued by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris 8 Mar 2018Clearly, though, Nissan wants to keep the urban chic aspect of the Qashqai going and that’s exactly what it has gone for – in conjunction with ad agency TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris.The latest TV ad features the punchline “Cityproof” and shows how you can go a bit wild even in the middle of “civilisation”.We see a bunch of daredevil “longboarders… young, funky men and women who whizz down hills on their roller boards at insane speeds, performing crazy stunts.I understand the ad took its inspiration from a crew of longboarders from Cape Town, Gravity Dogz, headed by Decio Lourenco. They were used in the ad to weave in and out as the Qashqai heads downhill, also accentuating the “Intelligent safety” features on the car, including blind-spot warning, cameras and emergency braking.It’s the kind of video vignette which attracts attention, as does the whole genre of adrenalin adventures… so it hits the target market spot on. At the same time, it does more than just push the brand, it details the virtues of the product. That is not always easy to achieve in one ad.Orchids to Nissan, TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris and Egg Productions, as well as the crew from Gravity Dogz. Big Ups, dudes.No big ups, unfortunately, for the latest ad for Castle Lager and its new 1-litre bottle. The copywriters strained every possible clever cell in coming up with the one-syllable expressions of – what is it? Howzit, I suppose. Or even… wonder? – in rolling out bru (brew,geddit?); bro, bruski, etc etc.Four people gathered at their door to greet the long lost buddy who has returned with his enormous 1-litre bottle of beer and they express their glee when he arrives. He only has one bottle, though.Which means that the total of five people only get 200ml each… and you see them with their pathetically small glasses.Who on earth only has 200ml of beer?The ad is a silly attempt at being clever in the first place and, even though it is an ad, badly fails at the first test of logic. So it gets an extra-large Onion (to be split between the copywriters).
