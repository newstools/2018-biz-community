This takes careful design, and commitment of both parties to consistently delivering four-star international service standards and products, and Bon Hotels have certainly proved their worth."Addressing guests at the event, CEO of Bon Hotels International West Africa, Guy Stehlik confirmed the group’s dedication and enthusiasm to the hotels they manage and market, and moreover their commitment to the upliftment, success and transformation of the Nigerian hospitality industry: "With owners who are wholeheartedly passionate about our brand, with the value and experience our board, management and staff bring to the table, we are undoubtedly confident about our success in Nigeria."
