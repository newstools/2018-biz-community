We place a huge focus on work that is simple and creative but most importantly work that delivers results for our partners – and the work that has been recognised has done exactly that.” The good news comes off the back of a great year in 2017 for Levergy, where they were awarded nine awards, including Campaign of the Year and Agency of the Year, at the 2017 edition of the Sport Industry Awards and welcomed new partners on board including Sasol and the JAG Foundation among others. “It’s a great way to end off a good first quarter of 2018 for the agency. We have started the year off with a bang and will be making some more big announcements very soon,” added Clint Paterson, Levergy CEO. “I want to thank the Sport Industry SA Group and the steering committee members for their recognition. We look forward to hosting the judges and wish everyone involved the best of luck. We’ll see you at the awards evening!” For more information on Levergy and for contact details go to www.levergy.co.za or follow @levergy_sa on Twitter or @levergy_official on Instagram.
