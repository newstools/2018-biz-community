On top of that, workers will receive a one-off payout of €356 to mark the 70th anniversary of the Porsche 356 sports car.Some 23,000 of the nearly 30,000 people it employed by the end of last year would be eligible for the bonuses, the company said in a statement."Porsche employees deserve every cent of the bonus," said Uwe Hueck, head of the council that represents Porsche workers. "These outstanding results were not handed to us on a plate - they were achieved with a lot of hard work."Bonus bonanza amidst scandalsThe bonus bonanza comes even though the German auto industry has been dogged by controversy ever since Porsche's parent company Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to installing software in millions of diesel cars to cheat pollution tests - including in Porsche models.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422134.jpg" alt="Ex-VW exec sentenced to seven years for 'dieselgate'" width="120" height="120">Ex-VW exec sentenced to seven years for 'dieselgate'A US court on Wednesday sentenced former Volkswagen executive Oliver Schmidt to seven years in prison for his role in the German automaker's "dieselgate" emissions cheating scandal...By Douglas Gillison 8 Dec 2017Suspicions of emissions cheating have since spread to other carmakers, shattering diesel's image as a clean engine and prompting several smog-clogged German cities to mull diesel driving bans.The scandal deepened earlier this year when it was revealed that a research body funded by Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler commissioned tests that measured the effects of diesel exhaust fumes on monkeys.Despite the damaging headlines, German carmakers enjoyed a stellar year in 2017.Porsche rival BMW earlier this week announced record bonuses of 9,455 euros for each employee, while Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz is handing out 5,700 euros.Source: AFP
