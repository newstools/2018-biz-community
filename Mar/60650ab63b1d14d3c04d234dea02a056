Each team, comprising of 2 – 5 members, needs to submit an initial 2-minute video after attending a drop-in session on 27 March 2018 to better understand the issue, project and overall requirements. The first deadline is 24 April, after which a shortlist will be announced on 2 May.  Submissions can include a well-defined proof of concept; data modelling and recommendations based on data analysis; detailed research with recommendations for future activities; and the use of technology to address the issue. Preliminary judging will take place in early July, after which final presentations and judging will be concluded at an award ceremony on 20 July. “The aim of the SITA Air Transport Community Foundation is to provide ICT and education for learners in Africa, and to help build key skills for the next generation. We created this Innovation Award to highlight the challenges and opportunities for a continent that is seeing a changing demographic coupled with growth in technology and aviation. It will provide a unique perspective for these future travellers to consider each touchpoint of air travel – from booking to navigating airports, boarding, and arriving at their destination. We’re delighted to be working with Wits and Tshimologong to run this initiative,” says Amber Harrison, Director Corporate Social Responsibility at SITA.For more information on the award, visit https://sita.wits.ac.za/
