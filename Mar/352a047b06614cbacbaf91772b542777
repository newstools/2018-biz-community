Finalists were judged across eight criteria: their sustainability strategy, water usage, energy usage, waste management, transport, catering, community involvement, and staff training.“The Davinci was built on the premise of maintaining a green footprint with as little impact on the environment as possible and we run a host of programmes internally to ensure we continue in keeping with this legacy,” states Andrew van Hasselt, general manager at the Davinci Hotel and Suites. “We are delighted to receive this award as it is a testimony to the fact that we remain committed to being a sustainable member of the local tourism and hospitality industry.” Commitment beyond expectationanAccording to Meetings Africa, while all the hotels who entered made efforts to be more sustainable, the Davinci Hotel led the majority of the selected categories and demonstrated a commitment beyond expectation. Other factors that led to its success included its ISO 14000 certification as well the fact that it is a high-ranking recipient of the heritage programme.The Meetings Africa awards are unusual in that the event only presents green awards to qualifying participants, according to organisers this is done to demonstrate its commitment to promoting sustainability within the business tourism industry. Now in its fourth year, the Green Hotel Award is a highlight of the Meetings Africa event. Participants only qualify to be considered for the award if they have signed the Meetings Africa sustainability pledge, complete a self-assessment questionnaire and provide supporting documentation around their environmental initiatives, and be available for an on-site visit.
