Without the transaction concluding, Lonmin, which is currently operating under suspended debt covenant conditions, would most likely breach those covenants, resulting in lenders demanding repayment of debt and crippling the company and its 30,000 employees.Froneman has been clear that it is in no one's interests for Lonmin to fail in an area already beset by community and labour unrest, with high levels of poverty and unemployment around the mines in Rustenburg feeding into the protests near Lonmin's Marikana operations in 2012, culminating in the death of 44 people, 34 of whom were shot by police.
