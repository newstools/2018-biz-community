When we do things to bring happiness to others, everyone benefits.”The ads, which are centred around the belief that "insurance is about people, not things", seek to build an emotional connection by focusing on what matters most to people – making them happy by insuring their happiness.“We want the Day of Happiness to be a celebration of acts of generosity, kindness, enthusiasm and connection - focused on bringing happiness to others,” said Catherine Karimi, chief executive officer, APA Life Assurance.“The concept of Insuring Happiness is about life and having the security of looking after – your family, business, assets or future goals.  We aim to, no matter the circumstance, to achieve, as individuals and a nation, happiness by offering our customers a comprehensive range of products and services to cover diverse personal and business requirements for insurance and investments.”“The creation of the International Day of Happiness followed on from the first ever United Nations conference on Happiness and Wellbeing and an earlier  UN resolution  calling for member states to place a greater focus on the happiness of their citizens,” commented APA Insurance,  chief executive officer, Vinod Bharatan.  “We have launched the campaign not just to spread happiness for one day or 356 days but for the rest of life.”Focused on insuring happiness, the campaign consists of television, radio, print and online advertising to depict a range of situations where people can achieve happiness.  The campaign will be rolled out over the next year.
