Facing weaker or higher-cost competitors, AT&T might raise its prices to subscribers."Most antitrust investigations are settled with an agreement calling for divestitures or other actions to preserve competition, so the court showdown represents a risk for both sides, analysts said.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/419346-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Rupert Murdoch |" width="120" height="120">Murdoch's Fox in talks with multiple buyers for TV, film assetsNEW YORK - Shares in media-entertainment giant 21st Century Fox surged to seven-month highs on Friday after news it has been holding talks with at least three potential buyers for some of its television and film operations...20 Nov 2017It will be the most high-profile antitrust case to hit the courtroom since the 1990s Microsoft litigation.While some analysts have claimed the case is politically motivated, Judge Richard Leon denied to hear evidence showing AT&T was singled out for prosecution."The case is going to trial without that political overlay," said Daniel Lyons, a Boston College Law School professor and visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.Lyons said the case could suggest new approach to antitrust by the Justice Department's new division chief, Makan Delrahim."This is a rethinking of vertical mergers," Lyons said.Still, Lyons said the government has an uphill battle to reverse decades of judicial precedent of a largely laissez-faire approach to mergers."If I were a betting person I would say the odds are in AT&T's favor," he said."But the fact that it's a loose standard gives some room for the government to win."A key question in the case is whether it represents a new approach to antitrust which could chill future mergers and acquisitions.Ryan Radia of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington policy group, expressed concerns about a growing trend toward what some call a "hipster" antitrust approach based on the notion that big business is bad and that any concentration could be harmful."It's hard to say whether this portends a different direction for antitrust," Radia said."There is a chance that some in this administration want to take antitrust in a different direction, but also that a future administration could use this as precedent."Source: AFP
