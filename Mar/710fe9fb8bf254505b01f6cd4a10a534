We encourage the hospitality sector to recycle their glass (bottles and jars) and, while we are impressed by the trend of ‘being green’, we need more commitment from bars, restaurants and hotels. Ultimately, we need these venues to live their green credentials,” says CEO of The Glass Recycling Company, Shabeer Jhetam.  The 10 venues and restaurants in Gauteng recognised for their glass recycling efforts, in no specific order are:• Casalinga (Muldersdrift) • Giles Pub (Craighall Park) • Jackson’s Real Food Market (Bryanston)• Morningside Country Club (Morningside)• Pirates Club (Greenside)• Society Eatery and Craft Bar (Fourways)• The Peech Hotel (Melrose North)• Tin Cup Driving Range and Restaurant (Alberton)• Whisk Wine Bar (Irene, Centurion)• Zoo Lake Sports Club (Parkwood) “We encourage these establishments to continue recycling all their glass and take it to the next level, as it has a progressive impact on the environment. We challenge others to start recycling as it is one of the easiest ways for them to have a positive impact on the world in which we live,” concluded Jhetam.
