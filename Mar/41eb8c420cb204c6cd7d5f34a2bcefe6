At the recent media launch, we took the E-Pace for a spin around Egoli where we made our way to Soccer City to experience the car's performance in the city and also out on the open road towards the Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve. What’s it like?The latest cub of the Jaguar family might be a premium compact SUV but having spent a day behind the wheel, it seemed to me more like a fiery teenager than an innocent cub.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432925-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lexus F-Sport: Winning hearts and wallets" width="120" height="120">Lexus F-Sport: Winning hearts and walletsLexus has been a determined soldier in the tough and highly-competitive battle for the hearts and wallets of South Africa's ever-growing army of SUV fans...By Henrie Geyser 2 days agoLook, the Jag is synonymous with luxury, that’s for sure. The seats are so comfortable it almost feels like the leather is hugging you, making it the perfect big spotted cat for long distances or short regular zipping around town. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433358-625x325.jpg?1" alt="#TriedAndTested: Jaguar E-Pace First Edition P250 and R-Dynamic HSE D240" width="625" height="325"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433361-625x325.jpg?1" alt="#TriedAndTested: Jaguar E-Pace First Edition P250 and R-Dynamic HSE D240" width="625" height="325">The car is a spacious, practical, and connected all-wheel-drive vehicle that doesn't fail to turn heads. Boot space is impressive with a luggage capacity of 577 litres.The E-Pace is extremely responsive and overtaking a car on the open road was a cinch. How about engine and safety stuff?We had the First Edition P250 petrol-powered version, which delivers 183kW of power and 500Nm of torque, for the first part of the day; and the R-Dynamic HSE D240 two-litre turbo diesel-powered, which delivers 177kW of power and 500Nm of torque, for the second part of the day. I found the petrol version to be a more satisfying drive. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433360-625x325.jpg?1" alt="#TriedAndTested: Jaguar E-Pace First Edition P250 and R-Dynamic HSE D240" width="625" height="325">I was impressed with the lane keep assist and distance control features which could be a life-saver for those becoming weary behind the wheel. I also had no problem to trust that the car will respond if and when it had to. As mentioned before, it is responsive - with a capital R. What else?Obviously, the next-generation Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) head-up display technology is a dream. In fact, digital connectivity can be found throughout the cabin, and there are up to four 12-volt charging points and five USB connections as well as a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot for up to eight devices. Just pop in a SIM your whole tribe is connected! <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428940-120x120.jpg?2" alt="New Jaguar E-Pace" width="120" height="120">Six defining design details on the new Jaguar E-PaceThe new Jaguar E-Pace performance SUV packs the design and performance of a Jaguar sports car into a spacious and practical all-wheel-drive vehicle...13 Feb 2018For some bizarre reason, we struggled with the navigation interface, but luckily our printed route map was accurate and allowed us to stay en route while trying to figure out the system without accidentally deleting a waypoint. Another cool feature of the E-Pace is the wearable Activity Key, which allows the driver to lock the main key inside the vehicle with a wearable device when enjoying outdoor activities such as surfing (anyone else like me who doesn't have an electronic-less surf key?!)How many bucks?The E-Pace is, unfortunately, not for everyone. It looks for a specific, more affluent customer and comes with a starting price tag of R598,500. ConclusionIn all honesty, the E-Pace is dashing and exudes confidence. According to Jaguar, it is the perfect companion for the modern family. So if you are into sports cars, but want to cry if you think you have to give up your sexy car to fit a child seat, pram, or lots of luggage in the boot, this feisty cub might just make your year.
