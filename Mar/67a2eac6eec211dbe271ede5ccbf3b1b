The agents, which are made up of 50 Australians and two New Zealanders, were given an attractive incentive: those who sold the most SAA flight tickets in September and October last year would earn a spot on the MegaFam trip to South Africa. Those who notched up the most sales booked their place on the trip and went on to complete the SA Specialist training course, equipping them with the knowledge to sell South Africa as a destination.Throughout the first three weeks of March, six groups of Australasian Flight Centre travel agents will be enjoying six different weeklong itineraries showcasing an array of attractions across the length and breadth of the country.Equipping the Australasian travel trade"We view Australasia as an international market with high growth potential and would like Australians and New Zealanders to explore more of what South Africa has to offer when they come here on holiday or to visit friends and family."That’s why we are excited about this opportunity to partner with and equip the Australasian travel trade to confidently sell South Africa as a value-for-money destination offering a wealth of diverse experiences. Through initiatives such as these familiarisation trips, we hope to make further inroads into achieving our five-in-five goal of attracting five million more tourists by 2021," says Sthembiso Dlamini, chief operating officer of South African Tourism. Dlamini says that the itineraries were carefully tailored to showcase the country’s untouched wildlife, its reputation as an adventure playground, its buzzing city life, its inspiring and welcoming locals, its sun-soaked coastlines, its cultural richness and its breathtaking scenic beauty.Encouraging geographical travel, responsible tourismEach group of agents will travel to between two and four provinces, including the country’s less-frequented areas, to encourage the geographic spread of tourism."Those visiting the areas affected by the water shortage will be able to experience first-hand the country’s #WaterWiseTourism drive in action and will see that South Africa remains very much open for tourism, with responsible tourism practices becoming entrenched as the ‘new normal’," adds Dlamini. In light of 2018 marking the centenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth, the agents will have the opportunity to walk in Madiba’s footsteps, visiting some of the sites around South Africa where he left his indelible mark."We are also proud to be empowering the local people who are best equipped to highlight the attractions in our various provinces, by enlisting, wherever possible, the services of regional tour operators that are Lilizela Tourism Award winners and finalists, as well as exceptional small businesses," concludes Dlamini.
