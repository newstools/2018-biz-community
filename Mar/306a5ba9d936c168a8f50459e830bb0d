Live talks and interactive demonstrations will also be offered. “The !Khwa ttu San Heritage Centre is a great deal more than a collection of artefacts and historical photos. It's a pioneering initiative that embraces the principle of community curation, led by a team of academics and San consultants from across southern Africa. Our exhibitions, San-led trails, and guided experiences are designed to engage the body and senses as much as the mind,” explains Michael Daiber, general manager of !Khwa ttu. “They demonstrate the skills and knowledge of the San people, while also telling the archaeological story of the origins of the modern mind on the southern African coastline.”The heritage centre, when complete, will incorporate several of the old farm buildings and an innovative new building that follows the natural contours of the land, with a curved, planted roof. In keeping with the 'tread lightly’ San way of life the centre incorporates sustainable measures for lighting, heating and cooling.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434860-625x325.jpg?1" alt="Photo: Di Brown, West Coast Way" width="625" height="325">Photo: Di Brown, West Coast Way!Khwa ttu scoops top award for responsible tourismTellingly, and unsurprisingly, the centre recently won the To Do! 2018 award - one of the most coveted awards in socially responsible tourism. The To Do Awards honour tourism-related projects and measures which respect the interests of the local population. “In 1998, the Working Group for Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) agreed that the San needed assistance in training their own people to deal with tourism and how to showcase the San culture to the world. In 1999 the farmland was purchased to create this dream. The original buildings on the farm were converted and the agricultural land was restored to a nature reserve,” explains Daiber.!Khwa ttu is run as a non-profit company and the centre celebrates the San culture and spirit - both the past and present – by educating the general public about the world of the San, providing training to the San, restoring and protecting the cultural heritage of the San, and promoting the long-term financial sustainability of San development in southern Africa. Hence the !Khwa ttu ethos of ‘San Spirit Shared’.Minister of Economic Opportunities, Alan Winde, says that !Khwa ttu is a truly unique heritage offering for visitors to the Western Cape and its expansion is exciting news. “The new San Heritage Centre looks set to become an important tool in preserving our history and sharing our stories.”
