The non-conscious experiment, which took just a few minutes to complete, left attendees curious. We were encouraged to sit at two desks to participate in the study – categorising first terms then company logos with associated terms as either pleasant or unpleasant by pressing a button on the left or right of the keyboard – as fast as possible, with a red X appearing when we were incorrect. Ten minutes later, we were done.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/407679.jpg" alt="Columinate develops methodology to measure nonconscious attitudes and perceptions" width="120" height="120">Columinate develops methodology to measure nonconscious attitudes and perceptionsModern insights agency Columinate has unveiled its latest methodology, which measures a research participant's nonconscious attitudes and behaviours toward certain concepts, brands, services, or products, effectively allowing the researcher to “read minds”. Well, almost...Issued by Columinate 24 Aug 2017Experiment interacted with, a satisfying hot brunch in our bellies and attendee introductions made, Alex de Coning, marketing manager of Columinate, welcomed attendees by talking through the day’s agenda before introducing Columinate CEO, Dr Henk Pretorius.Pretorius took a slight detour through the history of Columinate, founded a decade ago, before his main presentation on the current state of Columinate, while also explaining why the non-conscious experiment was created and how it works – the faster your response, the more positive your connection to the brand you see flash on screen – the logo isn’t necessarily linked to the descriptor phrase. Pretorius added that the statements used in the experiment can’t be long sentences so that a longer response time isn’t attributed to reading. Pretorius said his research team was reading our minds through this new methodology that uncovers implicit associations consumers may not even be conscious of, in shifting the paradigm in the marketing research perspective through what they call ‘the measure of tomorrow’. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/401436-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Team Columinate." width="120" height="120">“Who said surveys should be boring?” - Elna Pretorius of ColuminateIf you thought market research was dry and bland, you've clearly not spoken to Elna Pretorius, cofounder of Columinate, who was responsible for the People's Choice Award paper at Samra 2017. Here's her view on the importance of digital market research in SA...By Leigh Andrews 14 Jul 2017When Columinate first started, their vision was to create better, faster, and cheaper ways to do research and get to those ever-elusive consumer insights, and while they were perhaps idealistic about the potential of the internet, they knew digital was already the answer back then. So while sparing us what he called 'the gory details of starting a company in a recession', Pretorius said they had aimed to drive the first fully-fledged digital local consumer insights research – a ‘modern market research agency’, if you will. The ‘measure of tomorrow’ is thus one methodology in a set they believe is the future of modern insights, all of which brands can immediately put into action.  Making the implicit actionable through behavioural science<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433292.jpg" alt="Dr Henk Pretorius, Columinate CEO." width="250" height="342">Dr Henk Pretorius, Columinate CEO.Pretorius said a focus on digital data collection is critical to their business in that regard, and they complement that with new data sources, known as data fusion. They also focus on automation, which to some seems negative as it implies standardised, inflexible methodologies. Instead, Pretorius says the reality is that automation facilitates decision making by keeping the human element, in allowing people to spend time on the aspects of the process that have the greatest impact: extracting insights – something he says data science researchers aren’t so good at.Explaining his personal perspective, Pretorius shared that he has always been focused on psychological insights. In summing up the way we currently measure opinions and behaviours, he pointed out that at present, we simply ask people how they feel, which is simple and works… until it doesn’t. For example, many consumers claim to love ‘green products’ but don’t actually use them, so the stated claims mismatch the actual behaviour. This links to why we don’t get completely overwhelmed in a shopping situation, when facing so many choices. We already have an idea of the brands we're going to purchase, so any last-minute decision-making changes in store tend to be based on a truly exceptional offer or sample.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/b/1507/283828-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Henk Pretorius" width="120" height="120">Thank you NSRI - For saving lives, and making great adsWe love a good ad. We love a good ad, because we love a good story told in a few moments...By Henk Pretorius, Issued by Columinate 3 days agoPretorius says it’s obvious then to ask: Why are our intentions not aligned with our actions? The answer is simple yet complex in itself:Lots of what we do each day is due to non-conscious processes – up to 90% of them, in fact. So non-conscious insights matter, but even if we agree with that statement, how do we go on to measure them?Pretorius shared that  the measurement is not limited to expensive options TV has brought to mainstream media's attention, like brain scanning imagery, but instead includes a full range from biometrics and other physiological responses, like heart rate.You can better understand this through behavioural economics, especially concepts such as priming and implicit associations.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432924-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Examples of retailers employing the new rules of attraction." width="120" height="120">The new laws of attraction to survive the retail apocalypseFCB Red Chicago's retail strategy group lead Curt Munk explains that retailers and marketers alike need to understand the new laws of attraction in order to survive what he dubs 'the retail apocalypse'...By Leigh Andrews 2 days agoPretorius also listed the advantages of a non-conscious insights-driven approach as follows: It is scalable; the non-conscious measures can be captured online; there’s no need for expensive equipment like electrode caps; it’s cost-effective to run; there’s quick turnaround, and there’s a strong scientific background of over 40 years. They can also assess a range of different associations, not just good or bad, and apply the methodology for brand measures or tracking, as well as ad testing, new ideas, product packs and almost anything else.Pretorius further sparked the interest of marketers in the room when he spoke us through the importance of understanding brand imagery profiles and how they're linked to your consumers' non-conscious or implicit associations. So, knowing your own brand profiles, as well as how they differ from those of your competitors, means you’ll know which associations to leverage in future communications, and which to steer clear of as they have negative connotations for your consumers.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432014-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Richard Shotton, author of The Choice Factory." width="120" height="120">Get into your consumers' brain with Richard Shotton's The Choice FactoryRichard Shotton, deputy head of evidence of Manning Gottlieb OMD, and author of The Choice Factory: 25 Behavioural Biases That Influence What We Buy, shares how behavioural science findings can sharpen your brand's advertising and overall creative impact...By Leigh Andrews 6 Mar 2018Doing so will also clarify which attributes of your own brand statements are genuinely important to include in research, and which are merely there as you always include them. Pretorius recommends including 20 to 25 statements, both positive and negative, across five brands for optimum insights. He adds that any opinion you can verbalise, they can test. Pretorius ended with apologies to Carl Jung with the quote:Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life research and you will call it fate.Non-conscious brand insights in action – the Coca-Cola experience<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433294.jpg" alt="Debbie Hishin, knowledge and insights manager at Coca-Cola South Africa." width="250" height="347">Debbie Hishin, knowledge and insights manager at Coca-Cola South Africa.Guest speaker Debbie Hishin, knowledge and insights manager at Coca-Cola South Africa, then shared how the brand is using Columinate’s methodology to further their own research interests and insights by putting these non-conscious insights from consumers into action.Hishin began by explaining her own career journey in 'mind science', with the reminder that any new approach or methodology should not be about “chucking out what you’ve learned before,” but rather about making bite-size changes along the way. She adds that this is a true mind science as it’s not just neuromarketing processes, it’s about how it all works together.Hishin says previous consumer research was only showing them a piece of the puzzle. And as a ‘love brand’, their focus is primarily on how to get people to love them more, and drink more of all the brands under the Coca-Cola umbrella. Similar to Pretorius’ point about a mismatch in stated claim and actual behaviour over ‘green brands,’ Hishin reports everyone was saying they love the Coca-Cola brand, but volume consumed was going down. South Africans tend to over-please and over-claim, and give brands a big tick, whether we truly love them or not.Scary group-think implications aside, Hishin loved that she could slice and dice the data in different ways. For example, everyone wants to focus on millennials at the moment. Explaining the background for this, she said previously they had assumed teens like the brand as much as adults do, largely by tracking what adults were doing on a conscious level. But you know what they say about assumption...So, by instead looking at the implicit and explicit data combined, they were able to pinpoint where the brands are vulnerable regionally across the country, as well as with teenagers as a core demographic for the first time. They were able to use this data as an early warning system of sorts, by identifying the brand’s vulnerabilities, and then overlay this with information about their competitors, to see if the behaviour was based on something about the brand or something about the consumers. It's a fascinating shift.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1511/320219.jpg" alt="Research that is mobile too, not just mobile-only" width="120" height="120">Research that is mobile too, not just mobile-onlyIs it ever acceptable for research to be online only or only mobile? Columinate investigated and found that providing freedom to choose is as important in research design as it is in life...Issued by Columinate 11 Nov 2015Hishin emphasised her earlier point that focusing on consumers' non-conscious decision-making is not about running with these new insights and throwing the old baby out with the bath water. Instead, it means the brand can look at the business a lot more honestly, based on its true weaknesses and, in the case of a global brand like Coca-Cola, use these pinpointed local insights as an add-on. They’re now doing advertising, in-store testing and pack testing as a result of those insights, and can see the difference.Looking to future insights, Hishin said these are the true pulse of how people feel, and that strategic decision-making should no longer be dependent only on ‘thinking metrics’. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/408278-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Allan Swart ©" width="120" height="120">#Pamro2017: Data is becoming the oil of consumer marketingLeana Less, vice president of global connections and media at Coca-Cola, explores the benefits of agile marketing if done correctly at this year's Pamro conference...By Juanita Pienaar 29 Aug 2017Hishin says the challenge lies in changing internal stakeholders’ way of thinking. She added that the research process is simple and far less complicated than traditional research, which is also better for respondents as it means they’re with the thinking upfront so likely to give faster, more reliable results.We need to understand that people are not rational beings, so if we do 100% of research at the conscious level, we’ll always need to find a way to explain the mismatch between stated data to actual behaviour.Hishin ended with a reminder that the Coca-Cola brand targets those with anything from R5 and those with R500 in their pocket, which means almost everyone across the globe is a potential consumer to them. As you can’t include sentences in the non-conscious experiment, they had to think cleverly to turn taglines into words. But as we know, consumers don’t have time to read lengthy paragraphs today - I'm surprised you made it this far through my overview! Instead, we're primed to make decisions on single words so it’s clever that the methodology taps into how we’re already thinking about brands in 2018.Visit the Columinate press office or follow them on ‏Twitter or Instagram for more information.
