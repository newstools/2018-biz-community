She also has a few other projects in the pipeline. Tracey says she will miss the listeners the most. “Being a part of the Heart FM family has been everything I’d hoped it would be and allowed me to do what I’d set out to do when I decided to pursue a career in broadcasting - giving people the platform to share their stories. Fortunately this won’t end, with the start of another new TV show that will be announced in the next few weeks. I will miss the listeners endlessly and all the fun I had with them on air daily. I will cherish my three years with the listeners forever.”Heart FM’s Head of Programming Denver Apollus says Tracey’s absence will be felt. “Tracey is an industry professional and her contribution to the mid-morning space has seen the show grow in numbers. We will miss her bubbly personality and energy she brings to the show.”Managing Director for the station Renee Redelinghuys echoes Apollus’ sentiments. “Tracey has an infectious energy to which people are naturally drawn. Her laughter and banter with the boys in the morning, especially the high pithed “Hi” which has become synonymous before her show will be missed. Even the flou-jokes which she introduced. Tracey is a true professional in every sense of the word and there is no doubt that her star will only shine brighter from here. We thank Tracey for her contribution to the station and the Heart FM family as a whole.”
