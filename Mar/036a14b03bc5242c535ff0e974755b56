The MOU seeks to exchange economic information on a regular basis, provide mutual assistance to understand respective markets and policies regarding trade, foster enterprise linkages, improve market access and cooperate jointly in the promotion of seminars, forums and international trade shows.High growth marketRecognised as an important high-growth market that shows high export potential for South African products and services, Wesgro CEO, Tim Harris commented: “Our trade team will look to establish contacts with importers, distributors, chambers and business organisations to further assist us in facilitating exports from the Western Cape and strengthen our trade ties with Colombia."Harris added "According to our Global Economic Priorities for the Cape 2018/19, Latin America is expected to recover in 2018, with the region projected to grow from 1.9% in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019. Boosting our trading relationship with this region will, therefore, be a worthwhile investment in the next few years." The OSM to Colombia is a result of a scoping mission that took place in 2015. DTI Minister Rob Davies, stated: “The technical mission identified an impressive number of business opportunities for South African companies to develop and increase trade between the two countries. Results from the mission recommended emphasis should be on value-added products especially in the mining, industrial and automotive sectors.”Trade between South Africa and Colombia has grown from R419 million in 2011 to more than R858 million in 2017. The positive growth has largely been attributed to the government’s export-oriented growth strategy and improved security initiatives.
