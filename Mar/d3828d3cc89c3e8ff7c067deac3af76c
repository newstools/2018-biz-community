Sibanye-Stillwater recently extended its existing sponsorship by a further R15m over three years, bringing its total sponsorship of the WMI to R27.5m between 2015 and 2020. “The launch of the DigiMine establishes a unique programme that is instrumental for the application of digital technologies in support of safer and more efficient mining operations,” says Neal Froneman, Sibanye-Stillwater CEO, about the importance of the mining industry harnessing the fourth industrial revolution and fully benefitting from advances in digital technology through close ties with research institutions.Sibanye-Stillwater and Wits University are supporting students, strategic projects and growing the DigiMine programme, which leverages a growing range of on-site facilities with multi-disciplinary research that draws on expertise from other departments at Wits University, and from partners locally and abroad.Safety and competitiveness“This partnerhip between WMI and Sibanye-Stillwater paves the way to develop digital technologies that will reduce risk in the mining environment. Safety and competitiveness are cornerstones of a sustainable mining sector, which can contribute to the National Development Plan by reducing poverty and inequality. Our interventions will explore any innovations that can apply real-time digital solutions for reducing mining risk and increasing mining efficiency,” said Professor Fred Cawood.
