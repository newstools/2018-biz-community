This growth correlates with figures released in February 2017 of 368 RPLs and 468 RPAS, providing further proof that the drone community has come to terms with South Africa's leading RPAS legal framework.In comparison to the explosive growth seen in RPLs and registered RPAS, the number of approved operators, or ROCs, and training centres remains low with 20 ROCs and four training centres approved. For an industry still in its infancy, these numbers are likely to increase due to the factors of growing market demand and as expertise filters throughout the industry, within the regulatory, operator and training environment. Since the third quarter of 2015, DJI has increased its drone registration market share in South Africa steadily. This relates to worldwide drone ownership trends, where DJI holds a 70% total market share as reported by the Financial Times on 10 August 2017. For more, download the report here.
