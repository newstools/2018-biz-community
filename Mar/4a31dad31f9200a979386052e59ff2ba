The agency has a long history with Mondelēz and MD Luca Gallarelli said it felt like the gum brands were coming home: “We have a lot of love for, and experience with, Mondelēz and believe we did some breakout work for them in the past with campaigns like Mega Mystery Flavour & Klein Kimmie. We invested a significant amount into research and innovation to win the Clorets, Stimorol, Dentyne and Chappies digital work.”TOOK, an Ogilvy proprietary tool, was used to research consumer preferences and to unearth insightful nuggets for strategy and creative development. The agency challenged the concept of pre-determined social media work and demonstrated how social listening and AI would grow engagement and drive contextual relevance with the target audience. Gallarelli says “Now-ness or ‘owning the now’ was at the heart of our pitch - the brands being in the moment and creating content that really resonates with the right consumers as a result”.
