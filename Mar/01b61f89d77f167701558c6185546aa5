Smith said that most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have scanty or lack real-time data on livestock disease outbreaks, especially in arid and semi-arid areas.“Although livestock makes up 40% of the total agricultural GDP [gross domestic products] globally, we have given low attention to the sector which can help the rural poor,” Smith said.Karen Smyth, SEBI’s deputy-director, said that addressing challenges in livestock health and productivity needs a better understanding of the available data. “We need to bring together livestock data suppliers and users,” Smyth told SciDev.Net, explaining that it would help develop opportunities to share livestock data and innovations that can help smallholders.Capacity to use data a major problemBut Musa Mulongo, senior programme officer of the International Development Research Centre, Canada, said that lack of data is not the major problem facing livestock but the capacity of policymakers to use the data available to make decisions.   Mulongo added that the continent needs to increase studies in livestock diseases and the involvement of smallholders in such studies, and cited the mismatch between academic training and entrepreneurship as a problem.”We need entrepreneurs who can help commercialise new technologies that can help in the collection and processing of livestock data,” explained Mulongo. “We are not harnessing the power of technology [such as drones] to survey and fight livestock diseases.”Mulongo urged policymakers and scientists to increase collaborations and avoid over-reliance on donor-funded projects.
