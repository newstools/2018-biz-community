After 17 years of isolation and economic sanctions, this historic transition has raised the population's expectations, especially around economic recovery and job creation in a country suffering from widespread unemployment.Gearing up to face these challenges and preparing Zimbabwe to re-engage with the rest of the world, President Mnangagwa will present his country's economic potential to the international investor and business community at the Africa CEO Forum.As the world's third-largest platinum producer and with abundant diamond reserves, significant agricultural resources, and one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, Zimbabwe has a lot to offer. President Mnangagwa will share his vision for Zimbabwe's economic recovery before an audience of more than 1,200 business leaders, international investors and policy makers.The Africa CEO Forum’s exclusive inter-presidential panel will give President Mnangagwa the opportunity to engage with Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria. Having emerged from a long period of economic isolation, Nigeria offers a solid example on which to base discussions on strategic priorities that must be implemented to revive Zimbabwe's economy and put an end to sanctions.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/431760-120x120.jpg" alt="Spotlight on Africa's disruptive technologies" width="120" height="120">Spotlight on Africa's disruptive technologiesThe Africa CEO Forum, which is holding its 6th edition on 26 and 27 March 2018 in Abidjan, will turn the spotlight on Africa's disruptive technologies...2 Mar 2018President Mnangagwa is not the only new president to use the Africa CEO Forum as a platform to meet with investors.
