I want to thank our extraordinary team members who helped build Toys 'R' Us into a global brand. I also want to express my appreciation for my colleagues on our board who have continued to provide support to sustain the brand and our operations throughout the restructuring process. I would also like to thank our vendors who we owe a great deal of gratitude to for their decades of support. This is a profoundly sad day for us as well as the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years.”Toys 'R' Us filed for bankruptcy in September with a plan to turn around the unprofitable retailer, but sales sputtered during the crucial holiday season, "and the company began missing payments to some suppliers in recent days, all but sealing its fate," reports Bloomberg.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/427106-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2018: The new rules of retail" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: The new rules of retailIf you're searching for proof that retail as we know it is changing, look no further than Shanghai's 24-hour, unstaffed, self-driving grocery store...By Lauren Hartzenberg 29 Jan 2018 Retail apocalypseThe chain is the most recent casualty of what's been dubbed a 'retail apocalypse' in the US. In 2017 alone 3,500 stores closed in the region, leading to approximately 30,000 retail jobs being lost. Department stores J.C. Penney and Macy's were among those that experienced hundreds of store closures.Euromonitor International's toys and games consultant, Tim Barrett, said that while the Toys 'R' Us closure is a gut check to legacy retailers that are struggling to adapt to modern retail realities, the development doesn't come as a surprise."In an age where shopping for toys is more efficient online or at Walmart, a big-box toy retailer with next to nothing in terms of service or experience doesn’t make a lot of sense. Had the chain embraced e-commerce earlier instead of outsourcing it to Amazon from 2000-2010 things might have gone differently. Had the chain made a bold move to reimagine stores, perhaps by adding in daycare centres, things might have improved. But Toys 'R' Us did none of these things. Spread thin across too many countries, with too many stores and too much debt, it boxed itself into its current fate.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432924-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Examples of retailers employing the new rules of attraction." width="120" height="120">The new laws of attraction to survive the retail apocalypseFCB Red Chicago's retail strategy group lead Curt Munk explains that retailers and marketers alike need to understand the new laws of attraction in order to survive what he dubs 'the retail apocalypse'...By Leigh Andrews 3 days agoAfrica businessAs far as Toys 'R' Us operations in Southern Africa is concerned, it's business as usual. “Although these challenges will have ramifications on the global toy landscape‚ it must be clear that Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us South Africa are a privately owned South African enterprise‚ which merely pays a royalty to utilise the brand names and operates completely independently from its global counterparts‚” said Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us SA marketing manager Nicole Annells.In fact, the local company has invested heavily into upgrade projects nationwide, noting the soon-to-be-unveiled flagship Canal Walk store as its latest upgrade attraction.The aggressive expansion project has seen Toys R Us and Babies R Us launch seven new stores last year, with an additional one expected to open its doors next month.“We have maintained our momentum. Our revenue growth is solid, and Toys 'R' Us & Babies 'R' Us continues in a clear path of strengthening our brand footprint throughout South Africa,” said Annells.
