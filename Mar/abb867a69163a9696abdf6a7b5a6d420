It seems that Swedish music streaming giant Spotify may finally make a play in South Africa....By Andy Walker 6 Mar 2018Update, 13 March 2018: As the website shows, the service is available in free and premium flavours. The latter option matches Google Play Music and Apple Music at R60 a month. Not sure whether you’d like to take the premium plunge? Then you can try it out for 30 days.The free version features ads and radio stations with limited skips (so you can’t listen to any track you want). Opt for the premium version and you have access to any track you want, offline functionality, high quality audio and ad-free playback. Check out the website over here.
