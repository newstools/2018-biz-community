We have all kinds of disrupters in the audience. This event is about the state of freedom and human dignity across the world. We seek to humanise human suffering, to encourage civil society’s involvement.” Mandela CentenaryThe forum was held in collaboration with the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Centenary. “Nelson Mandela was an inspiration to activists across the world, whether it was North Korea defectors or women’s rights’ advocates in Saudi Arabia. It is an incredible honour for us at OFF to work alongside those who are tasked to be the guardians of Mandela’s legacy,” says Halvorssen. Sello Hatang, chief executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation called the event “a critical moment where South Africa will be looking back and forward, with Mandela’s Centenary”, and asked how do we reimagine a South Africa that cares about the vulnerable in our society and live up to Madiba’s values, and building a values-based society? If we go back to why Madiba established the foundation, he continued, it was with three ideas in mind. “Democracy building, peace building and ensuring that we build a culture of human rights. If these three can be achieved in a day of reimagining human rights culture, a day where people put their own lives on the line to ensure there is no vulnerability around the world, then we will get somewhere.”He added: “Today is a day to shake the narratives that need shaking and for people to rethink democracy. It is for citizens to say what can I do to help others.” A platform for the ignoredToday, half the world’s population lives under authoritarian regimes, whether these are dictatorships or competitive authoritarian states. OFF is here to address that problem, Halvorssen said. “It was created as a platform to provide a voice to those who are ignored, or whose struggles have been ignored. The media is an important component of the forum.”  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434338-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#OFFinJoburg: Many a bumpy road ahead remains on Africa's long walk to democracy" width="120" height="120">#OFFinJoburg: Many a bumpy road ahead remains on Africa's long walk to democracyThe Oslo Freedom Forum (OFF) will make its debut in Africa on Monday, 26 March, in Johannesburg...By Sindy Peters 23 Mar 2018Sadly, the world’s democracies have failed at addressing the issue of tyranny across the world, so it is up to private individuals to help other individuals. “Engineers helping engineers, artists helping artists, veterans helping veterans, we gather here today in collaboration with the Nelson Mandela Foundation because we cannot depend on the governments of the free world to safeguard and promote human rights. It is up to civil society. The OFF extends a cordial invitation to any South African to join our movement.”  The speakers we have brought here are here to speak with you and to share their experiences, and to learn about yours, he adds. Hatang also alluded to this event being a teaser for many more and a bigger forum next year.
