"We have already held discussions with other organisations in organised agriculture. Free State Agriculture will play a leading role in helping others get similar initiatives off the ground to benefit or support members in other provinces."OppieStoep storyteller Andries Vermeulen is the official ambassador of this initiative and will help expand it nationwide. Vermeulen encourages everyone to proactively become part of it and â€œto move with us."Kriel says the idea is to take hands in a productive and meaningful manner to make people aware of the importance of the agricultural sector, as everybody needs a farmer at least three times a day during meals. The initiative forms part of FSA's overall vision of promoting a safe and sustainable agricultural environment in the interests of agriculture in the Free State."Diet foods of healthy eaters, burgers and chips of take-away meals and the formal dishes on our tables all came from the hand of a hard-working farmer," says Kriel. "With Friends of Free State Agriculture, we want to make the public aware of the conditions in which food is produced."Support and assistanceThe support and assistance provided by Friends of Free State Agriculture will assist farmers, among other things, with issues such as farm safety, land affairs, and the creation of a disaster fund for assistance in crises such as fires, droughts and floods.Part of the initiative is the launch of a security application called Die Plaaswag. The application or app, of which FSA is a partner, works with a panic button and will improve the safety of farmers and the public. It also aims to gather accurate crime statistics that FSA can use in combating crime in the Free State.For more information, visit Friends of Free State Agriculture.
