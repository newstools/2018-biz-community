Egg prices remain high as a result of the avian flu outbreak.The outlook for food inflation should continue to ease in the coming months. This will be influenced by relatively large grain stocks from the previous season, expectations of a good harvest in the summer crop growing areas of the country, and the expected normalisation in livestock slaughtering activities.Listeriosis outbreakAs polony has been identified as the primary product source of the outbreak, current trends indicate that polony price (per kg) has decreased by 7.5% m-o-m but reported growth of 1.7% when compared to February 2017. The possible impact at retail level could be assessed in four months (the average time lag for price response between producer and retail level).
