Naturally, this would depend on product and target market – but a growing trend is now looking at re-incorporating traditional media - as long as there is continuity, innovation and flair across all channels. And many agencies are coming up with just that. Media across the board holds great potential. Above the line, below the line, through the line – and the great online. Above-the-line (TV, radio, print) advertising still carries prestige over posters, direct mail, competitions, etc., but BTL has the advantage of more accurate targeting and measurability.  While ATL is associated with big budgets and campaigns that drive awareness, BTL can leverage more personal engagement and optimise opportunities within their target market.  It’s celebrity versus functional; a big splash versus a close-up, personal message. There may be less creative awards in BTL, but there can be a sense of greater connection with customers.Technology has put all advertising on an equal footing, providing fresh opportunities to engage and connect across all forms of media. The onset of online blurs the line between, powers through the line, and presents a connective tissue between one media and another. TV ads can play as videos; a storyline begun on radio can offer an online competition with clues; combinations blending can create great cross-over marketing in all sorts of original ways. Suddenly, there’s a host of ways to get your message across and measure the response. The power of combinationTaking a campaign through the line and weaving it together with social media is creating bolder more daring opportunities to impact and sustain an effect through established methods like segmentation and value of algorithms with regard to customer targeting and purchase tracking. Multi-channel media planning can now seamlessly join both above and below the line strategies in one powerful campaign.With through-the-line (TTL) media planning, direct marketers (utilising cell phones, email, websites, online advertising, as well as flyers, catalogues, etc, with strong ‘call to actions’) and traditional advertisers can integrate campaigns with consistent messaging and collaborative creativity. The trick to success when using this combination is to ensure that each channel appeals to its best target market. You would use TV and radio to drive awareness, print such as magazines and posters to encourage people to take action, in-store competitions or giveaways to create the good feeling, and social media to entrench retention, build response, and garner brand advocates. A campaign integrated in this way should always work to enhance the customer’s experience while keeping business objectives in sight. The creative arcThe real route to success through the variables of channel choice remains the ability to sync the experience for the customer through impact, innovation and the unexpected. The TV ads of the past will probably not work when set alongside the fast-flicker of the Internet today. However, if brought together with entirely fresh thinking and the almost limitless options offered by technology, then truly you have a brave new world – provided channel specialists have the ability to cleverly blend and refocus to ensure that strategy continually aligns and reforms. TV will intrigue, radio will persuade, print will enlighten, and online will refine and pinpoint communications into one-on-one connection with the right customer, at the right time. A host of technical data is at your fingertips to measure, maintain and tweak your strategy to keep your product or service top of mind while consistently motivating the customer to take action.
