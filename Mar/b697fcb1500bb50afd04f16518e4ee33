A recent increase in the number of educated individuals within the segment has given rise to a flowing black middle class that consists of corporate professionals and entrepreneurs. Flowing middle class because they tend to move out once they have made enough money but are always replaced with the next generation thus creating a flow. This has brought about a steady growth in infrastructures such as township-based malls and shopping plazas, as well as an increase in government built and private homes. The lack of knowledge within this unique market has led to a disconnect between brands and the segment consumers. Let’s explore ways in which the gap between brands and the township segment can be closed.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1705/393315-120x120.jpg" alt="How to market to Africa's resilient, ambitious middle class" width="120" height="120">How to market to Africa's resilient, ambitious middle classHow do you market to Africa's extremely aspirational middle class that is more than 100 million strong, with a combined monthly spending power of R1.3 trillion?By Louise Marsland 22 May 2017Township consumers are known to be mobile. So, you will have to actively find them in order for engagement to start, the best places to target them would be the following: Shopping centers and mallsThe increase in township infrastructure has given birth to a large number of malls and shopping plazas, which are located within the township. This gives brands the opportunity to directly engage with consumers through brand promotions and activations. Taxi ranksAlthough a number of township consumers do own their own personal vehicles public transport still ranks as the primary mode of transport amongst the township population. It’s not rare to find at least two major taxi ranks within one township. Brands could invest in billboards or adverts that are found on screen monitors in the taxi rank to increase their brand exposure.Sporting eventsIt's no secret that sports are a favoured past time amongst the township population. Soccer and netball are two of the biggest sports played, with weekend matches being organised and monthly tournaments which bring a huge number of participants as well as spectators. These events give brands the opportunity to increase their exposure by sponsoring tournaments. Social gatheringsFrom taverns to dance clubs to monthly social events, there is never a dull or uneventful moment within the township. Brands could create their own unique promotions to target this audience either by using activations or by sponsoring a social event themselves.OnlineThe days of printing out pamphlets and using that as a marketing strategy are dead. Consumers are spending more time online either surfing the web or on social media, the township market is not exempt to this. With an increase in smartphones and easier access to the internet (free Wi-Fi found near some libraries, clinics, and schools).It would be very advantages for brands to focus on building digital relationships with this segment this could easily be done through social media.Now that we have discussed the best ways to reach your audience we will discuss the four ways one can engage with the segment.These four factors contribute to an increase in engagement amongst this segment:Product trial: Product or service demonstrations allow for an increase in positive word of mouth and increase product/service knowledge amongst those present. Positive word of mouth is the most powerful tool for purchasing decision amongst this segment.  Brand specials: Offering unique package deals such as loyalty cards and 2 for 1 specials as well as discount pricing leads to an increase in the possibility of purchase.Social media: This segment is one of the fastest growing segments on social media the use of Facebook and Twitter serves as a platform for direct engagement and could increase the brand’s exposure.Target by region: Divide the segment by region and learn how to effectively communicate with each region. Because the African market is so complex something that worked in Soweto may not have the same effect in Mamelodi. It’s wise to research the different types of languages and cultures each region has in order to maximise engagement.This market has proven to be unique and ever-changing and as such brands need to keep themselves informed if they wish to effectively engage with this segment.
