This is a three-day event of inspiring talks, dialogues, hands-on exploration, and futures oriented analysis aimed at mobilising and inspiring stakeholders to undertake collective actions to promote innovation and the building of robust innovation ecosystems in Africa able to provide the enabling environment to finally address the perennial challenges facing the continent. The AIS is a dynamic event that is focused on How to promote innovation in Africa. The AIS promotes “synthesis” and it is not simply a tech-oriented platform. The AIS will include an Exhibition Track with up to 50 Start-ups and SMEs to showcase “Made in Africa” innovations to address the challenges facing the continent.
