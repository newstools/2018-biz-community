The assessments will provide unprecedented insights into the status of global biodiversity and land quality, both of which are essential to quality of life and healthy, productive ecosystems.Informing better decisions about natureOften called 'the IPCC for biodiversity', IPBES is the global science-policy platform tasked with providing the best-available evidence to inform better decisions about nature. The reports being launched at #IPBES6 were completed over three years by 550 scientists and experts from more than 100 countries.Four of the studies present the state of biodiversity and nature's contributions to people in the Americas; Asia and the Pacific; Africa; Europe and Central Asia. The fifth assessment report assesses the global problem of land degradation and available remedies. The five reports will be key inputs to a comprehensive IPBES global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, due for release in 2019, the first such global evaluation since the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.In addition to helping decision makers evaluate lessons learned and progress on major global development commitments - such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Paris Agreement on climate change - the reports will also provide vital information for setting biodiversity targets for the period after 2020.
