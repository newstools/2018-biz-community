Elameji wa Kabedi said that police seized his two phones, an audio recorder, and US$140.Elameji wa Kabedi said that when he was released a few hours later, authorities returned one of his phones and recorder, which was damaged during the arrest. He said that the security forces did not return the other phone and his cash.CPJ's repeated phone calls to General Louis Segond Kawara, a provincial police commissioner of Bukavu, and a WhatsApp message sent to his phone went unanswered.In Tshikapa, a city in Kasai province, security forces detained Pierre Tshiabu and Texas Tshipamba from the community radio station Notre Chaine Radio (NCR) while they were covering the protest, Tshiabu told CPJ.CPJ is aware of at least one other case of security forces stopping a journalist from filming a protest in the capital, Kinshasa. The journalist asked that details of the incident, including their name, be withheld for fear of reprisal.When asked for comment about the incidents, Colonel Pierre-Rombaut Mwanamputu, a spokesperson for the national police, told CPJ it was difficult for security forces to make the distinction between journalists and protesters."Everyone can wear a press jacket. It is not a sign that someone is a journalist," Mwanamputu said, referring to jackets with the word "Press" written on the front and back that some members of the media wear.Internet and social media shutdowns are also a regular occurrence since protests began.
