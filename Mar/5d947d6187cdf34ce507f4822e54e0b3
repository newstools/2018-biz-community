The results from Johannesburg were combined with those from Cape Town and the live announcement was made to tasters in both cities over Skype as well as on social media.Once every two years, the unique opportunity arises to not only take part in, but play a deciding role in determining SA’s top luxury wines from a selection of ten of the country’s finest at each event, priced at up to R2000 a bottle.The luxury red wine tasting will take place on 18 April in the same format.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433458.png" alt="Wine Cellar tasters determine top luxury white wines" width="600" height="450">Johannesburg Top Three:Ken Forrester, FMC Single Barrel 2014 – R 700Capensis, Chardonnay 2014 – R 950Sadie Family, Palladius 2015 – R 725Cape Town Top Three:Capensis, Chardonnay 2014 – R 950Ken Forrester, FMC Single Barrel 2014 – R 700Paul Cluver, Seven Flags Chardonnay 2016 – R 610 Overall results:Capensis, Chardonnay 2014 – R 950Ken Forrester, FMC Single Barrel 2014 – R 700Paul Cluver, Seven Flags Chardonnay 2016 – R 610All wines tasted during the luxury white wine tasting:1SpierFranks K Smit20152ReynekeNatural Chenin Blanc20163Sadie FamilyPalladius20154RaatsEden High Density Chenin Blanc20155Ken ForresterThe FMC - Single Barrel20136Paul CluverSeven Flags Chardonnay20167Uva MiraIcon Chardonnay20148Leeu PassantStellenbosch Chardonnay20159CapensisChardonnay201410Delaire GraaffTerrace Block Chardonnay2015Complete Wine Cellar tasting schedule for January-April 2018.
