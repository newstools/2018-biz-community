Valiant Swart, a treasure of local music, comes to visit the Showroom on 7 April 2018. Swart has been a fixture on the SA music scene since 1990. His particular brand of soulful blues, folk and country-rock, blended with indigenous South African influences like boeremusiek and kwela, has earned him a large, loyal following countrywide. Swart’s solo performances are the stuff of legend. With his acoustic guitar and harmonica, he combines his classic songs – some poignant, some sad, some absolutely hilarious, with the storytelling style of a true raconteur.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433518-625x417.jpg" alt="Showroom March-July line-up" width="625" height="417">Join Mel Botes for all the best acoustic songs from our favourite poets on 30 June 2018.
