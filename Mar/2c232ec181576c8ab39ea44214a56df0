While ostensibly protesting for the right of the black child to free quality education, these rogue elements have seen it fit to disrupt the education of learners at schools in Thohoyandou and of our own students on campus,” the university said.The management said it was concerned that the forced closure of the campus has disrupted the academic programme, which includes not only teaching and learning, but also some world-class research undertaken in science laboratories.“Its [closure] further stalled the progress with recovery projects on amongst others, student residences, as contractors were unable to access the campus. Ironically, it is primarily our students themselves who will suffer the negative impact of the current protests.”The university announced that the management was able to work extensively with NSFAS to ensure that all qualifying students were paid their outstanding allowances. NSFAS is still waiting for a few students to update their details.
