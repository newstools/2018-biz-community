Beaten by a narrow yet decisive margin, both the Volvo S90 and the Alfa Romeo Giulia are exemplary finalists in their own right.  The SAGMJ has run the WesBank South African Car Of The Year competition since 1986, with WesBank as its headline sponsor since inception. “We’re proud of our long-standing partnership with the SA Guild of Motoring Journalists, who deliver the SA Car of the Year. It is an industry award that has become the barometer for excellence, by recognising cars that set new benchmarks in their segments as well as the motoring world,” said Chris de Kock, CEO of WesBank.  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1709/411550-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The 2018 WesBank South African Car of the Year finalists" width="120" height="120">The 2018 WesBank South African Car of the Year finalistsDuring an event hosted in Johannesburg, MC Derek Watts announced the finalists for the 2018 WesBank South African Car of the Year competition...21 Sep 2017"AutoTrader supports the competition both as a sponsor and strategic marketing partner," said George Mienie, CEO of AutoTrader. “A Porsche winning Coty may seem a little controversial, but it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Based on AutoTrader search data, South Africans favour German vehicles – and the Panamera clearly fits the bill in this regard. While Porsche appears incapable of producing a vehicle that’s anything less than truly excellent, the Panamera specifically has won a multitude of international awards, including the highly sought-after Sports Car of the Year at the 2017 Golden Steering Wheel Awards,” he said.  MAPO International is the official digital scoring system developer and sponsor to the competition.   Each of the finalists was put through a stringent testing procedure by the peer-elected Coty jury at the Kyalami Race Track in Midrand. Here, the winning vehicle is evaluated and scored in relation to its segment competitors, with each vehicle’s final score determined by exterior design and styling; interior use of materials; interior layout; technology; engine performance; gearbox and transmission; engineering integrity and build quality; ride quality and refinement; steering and handling; affordability; value for money; and overall excellence.
