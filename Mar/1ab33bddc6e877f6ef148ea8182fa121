This is set to change with the announcement that the group is considering a capital raise and that the two main shareholders would at the same time, subject to favourable market conditions, sell down a portion of their shares to improve liquidity. The share issue is subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 11 April 2018.“This share placement is aligned to the group’s focus on improving its free float and share liquidity,” explains Maltz. “The placement will introduce additional institutional shareholders to the group, which will be beneficial to the free-float and liquidity in the company’s shares.”  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432840-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Shirley Maltz, CEO of HomeChoice Holdings.
