H&M is soon to follow suit.Both are also taking advantage of their thousands of stores, including for client delivery.When online sales are launched in new markets, "we get to profitability really quick," H&M financial director Jyrki Tervonen told investors in February.He said this was "thanks to the fact we already have a store network, we are a well-known brand, appreciated among the consumers."Missing out on a saleInditex has invested a lot in the renovation of its stores, removing the smallest ones in favour of huge flagship shops in city centres.Both groups are implementing systems to avoid missing out on a sale if for instance, the size isn't available for a customer, by telling him or her that the item is available online.Gildas Minvielle, head of the economic observatory at the French Fashion Institute, said their strategy was to combine both sales methods."Distributors that develop their stores and their online sales perform quite well," he said.Source: AFP via I-Net Bridge.
