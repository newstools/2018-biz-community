The ILO is an agency of the UN.Meintjes said the recent appointment of the beleaguered Bathabile Dlamini as minister in the presidency for women pointed to a lack of seriousness in addressing the challenges faced by women in the country, while good policy was not being implemented to change disparities faced by women."The big problem in SA is that we have good policy and just don't implement it. There is also a lack of will in broader politics. We are in a situation where at one point we were all proudly saying SA is a woman-friendly state, I just don't think we can say that anymore," said Meintjes. "Part of the reason is to do with the demobilisation of the women's movement. It packed its bags thinking the new democracy is on our side," she said.Source: Business Day
