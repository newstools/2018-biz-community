Ellis practiced growth hacking in startups such as Dropbox – enough said. In his now famous post, titled ‘Find a Growth Hacker for Your Startup’ he states: “A growth hacker is a person whose true north is growth. Everything they do is scrutinised by its potential impact on scalable growth.”  In the same post he also says, “The right growth hacker will have a burning desire to connect your target market with your must have solution. They must have the creativity to figure out unique ways of driving growth in addition to testing/ evolving the techniques proven by other companies.”Fundamental to a successful growth hacker is thus a passion to ignite a business so it goes from one to a billion in the shortest space of time and becomes the new Airbnb, Netflix, Amazon or Tinder! If you have ever wondered how certain (never heard of) startups became (household name) global enterprises ridiculously fast – it was mostly all down to, growth hacking.Quick pause here: Above, yes, are the roots of growth hacking – that is a concept founded in startup companies. Now, however, it is time to learn from growth hackers what they did and employ strategies and techniques across all industries and businesses so that they too mirror a healthy and superfast growth trajectory in the digital economy. More than ever it is time to think outside the box! What is interesting is that growth hacking craves the brainpower and courage of humans. Bring your whack to your hack, so to say. Are you a creative person willing to take risks and try new strategies and techniques? Are you ready to become a growth hacker within your company?
