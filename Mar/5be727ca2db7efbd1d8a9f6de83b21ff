But to capitalise on the steady growth of e-commerce and cross-border trade, retailers firstly need to ensure that they have an online presence. And secondly, it needs to be optimised for a user-friendly shopping experience. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433351-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#ECMA18: Unlocking the potential of data in enhancing CX" width="120" height="120">#ECMA18: Unlocking the potential of data in enhancing CXTapping into the potential of data to provide insight into consumers' thinking and behaviour may translate into an enhanced customer experience strategy...By Maroefah Smith 1 day agoThe conversion funnelReferring to the conversion funnel that is the online customer journey he noted that “of the 10,000 visitors to your site, only 60% will go to product area, only 30% will get to the shopping cart and only 3% will complete their purchase. And on mobile, these numbers are much less.”These stats helped illustrate just how important each leg of the consumer journey really is. Neumann identified the three keep phases of successful e-commerce:Attract – through marketing or lead generation Convert – with user experienceRetain – through delivery and customer serviceOptimising e-commerceAmong his tips for optimising the e-commerce experience was to prioritise research, data extraction and analysis as your starting point. He also said to measure your marketing KPIs - traffic and conversion KPIs, channel-specific KPIs, and financial KPIs.He emphasised the importance of having a secure payment method on your site. “Our Ipsos research states that half of all online buyers would purchase more if they were reassured by your check-out page. And one out of every five drops their purchase if forced to create an account.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433391-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cross-border e-commerce offers boundless growth opportunity for African business" width="120" height="120">Cross-border e-commerce offers boundless growth opportunity for African businessCross border e-commerce continues to provide significant growth opportunities for retailers and manufacturers with an international online product offering...1 day agoHe also spoke about harnessing the power of simplicity in terms of site design and what you’re offering, saying that a “less is more” approach works best because too many options mostly tend to confuse customers.In the era of omnichannel retail, Neumann noted that it’s vital to be consistent across all channels. While investment into physical retail can immediately be witnessed in a tangible way, e-commerce is an opportunity for high profit at relatively low costs. Little considerations like having a geo-localised pop-up on your site and having delivery options clear visible can make your site more attractive to international shoppers.With Neumann stating that “58% of customers will abandon their shop if one’s website isn’t loading quickly,” it’s clear that customer experience could indeed trump product.“Make your customer happy by creating the best buying experience possible.”
