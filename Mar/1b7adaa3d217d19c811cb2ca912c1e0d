I enjoy watching TED Talks and documentaries focusing on design and architecture.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424521-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2018: The call for authentic, experiential retail design" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: The call for authentic, experiential retail designIn today's dynamic business environment, we should be seeking to understand the trends impacting a broader range of industries, regardless of the business sector we're in...By Lauren Hartzenberg 8 Jan 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you believe will be the top trend in design during 2018?Design that has meaning and tells an authentic story.There is such a backlash to mass production that consumers are looking for uniqueness and products that are handcrafted or have a unique story behind their design or manufacture.Tell us something about yourself not generally known?I have been doing martial arts since the age of five.
