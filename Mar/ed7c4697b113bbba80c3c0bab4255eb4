According to the brand, this aggressive growth in Africa reflects the untapped opportunities offered by emerging markets for the chain, which already has over 16,700 restaurants in more than 100 countries. General manager of Pizza Hut Africa, Ewan Davenport, says, “We are on track with the African growth story we started in September 2014 and we are hugely proud of our progress. As we expand our footprint in these markets, we continue to add and develop strong local supply chain partners so that we can bring our top quality, affordable pizza to customers in African regions where pizza is not as prevalent as elsewhere in the world.” South Africa’s Gauteng and Western Cape provinces currently have the most restaurants in sub-Saharan Africa. Free delivery for online orders was recently launched in the competitive South African market and Davenport says this will be available in African markets in the near future. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425550-120x120.jpg?2" alt="SA franchising sector retains global appeal" width="120" height="120">SA franchising sector retains global appealDespite 2017 being a tough year for business and consumers, South Africa has remained a desirable destination for global brands looking to expand...17 Jan 2018“We started our journey in Johannesburg and it feels great that our 100th sub-Saharan Africa store is opening here now.

We are prepped, ready and looking forward to developing Pizza Hut restaurants in more African countries, ultimately making us not only the largest pizza brand in the world but also on the African continent,” Davenport concludes.
