They achieve this by applying innovative techniques using data analytics, process engineering, automation and robotics. As capable and integrated process, data and software engineers they design and implement solutions to ensure companies eradicate their bottlenecks, improve business performance and maximize productivity. BizWize counts many well-known South African businesses amongst its clients. "We evaluated a number of BEE partners and options and felt that the Pula/LRMG approach dovetailed with our growth strategy, as they are a black partner that is really prepared and committed to drive mutual benefit for all involved in the partnership," said Alwyn Labuschagne, joint CEO of BiZWize. "We also see a great cultural fit and the ability of ourselves as a young entrepreneurial company to leverage off the experience of a larger and experienced supporting team in the Pula/LRMG management partnership, while still rowing our own boat and shaping the direction of the company," Labuschagne added. LRMG is a strongly process-focused company itself, and much of its performance design and content is underpinned by excellent process planning. “We believe that adding a strong and dedicated process capability to the LRMG group is extremely valuable to our offering and our clients’,” says Ricky Robinson, CEO of LRMG. “We look forward to seeing the returns our clients can realise through BizWize’s data and analysis; workflow automation and optimization; and business performance consulting services.” With this being LRMG’s second acquisition of 2018, following the addition of Game On Performance Solutions to its group of companies in February, LRMG is positioned for substantial growth this year. Passionate about process and performance, LRMG walks the walk by basing its approach to performance optimisation on the very systems and techniques employed in its own organisation. Pula seeks to invest in companies to which it can really add value, and ones that are synergistic with LRMG. Some industries of interest include e-learning, management consulting, IT, HR, professional training and marketing and advertising. Deals are structured in a highly flexible manner and strong performance criteria are included to ensure committed growth is achieved through the collaboration.
