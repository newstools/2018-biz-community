Instead, garages are full of hobby and sporting gear and overspill from the main house, from holiday decorations to an extra fridge/freezer. South Africans can check out their own garages ahead of winter – they will amaze themselves by how much they boost their own bank accounts when they blitz this kind of clutter. The feel-good factor from contributing to the reselling market is also great.” <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1703/385447-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Are you a good fit for franchising?" width="120" height="120">Are you a good fit for franchising?Entrepreneurs contribute towards job creation, which motivates many people to want to start their own business, but how well do they know their business personality?By Richard Mukheibir 27 Mar 2017Global Recycling DayThe first-ever Global Recycling Day will be marked on 18 March 2018. This is an initiative of the Bureau of International Recycling and particularly focuses on what it terms the “Seventh Resource” – goods that we recycle, repurpose or reuse every day. To conserve and better use our six natural resources – water, air, coal, oil, natural gas and minerals – it challenges leaders and the general public to understand the necessity of recycling, support sustainable trade in recyclable materials and to work with industries to encourage reuse of goods and materials.  Economic spinoffsThere is still a lot of economic spinoff to be found in the second-hand trade, Mukheibir believes. In Sweden, for example, the municipality of Eskilstuna recently opened what is believed to be the world’s first shopping mall for recycled, reused and repaired goods, the ReTuna Recycling Galleria. Growing southern African interest in the worldwide second-hand trading trend has seen Cash Converters’ franchise outlets in our region increase by 16% in 2017 alone.“South Africa has also seen an increase in artisanal upcycling that is more than simply for personal pleasure and social-media chatter,” says Mukheibir. “Enhancing or upcycling goods for resale can and is creating small business opportunities.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/430465-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Trade in second-hand goods the hidden boom in SA economy" width="120" height="120">Trade in second-hand goods the hidden boom in SA economyWhile the formal South African economy is clearly struggling - the finance minister's grim budget on Wednesday confirmed that harsh truth - there is one key segment of the economy which is booming...By Claire Cobbledick 22 Feb 2018This makes the rise of second-hand trading a virtuous circle for all concerned, boosting local employment and income at every stage of the trading cycle, from homeowners to entrepreneurial crafters and dealers. Gumtree recently estimated that more than R1 billion is stashed in South African homes just in the form of “unused, good condition, resellable mobile phones". “Canny consumers have relearned the lesson of their grandparents that second-hand does not mean second rate,” says Mukheibir. “Our company tests all second-hand goods before they are brought in and makes their condition clear to the many prospective buyers who thrive on these bargains.”
