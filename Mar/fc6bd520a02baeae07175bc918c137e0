Home is the very place where we laugh, we cry, we grow up and raise our children so it's no wonder that we all want to tell our stories through our d√©cor and designs, mimicking the past, present and future between our four walls.The show presents the very latest in-home renovation, interiors, soft furnishings, lighting, kitchens, furniture, and more. It provides the opportunity to meet leaders in the home lifestyle industry with exclusive insider tips and professional advice. The expo features a significant amount of attractions to keep visitors informed and entertained ranging from demonstrations by DIY celebs to food theatres.GL events South Africa has been providing main contractor services to the expo for 25 years.
