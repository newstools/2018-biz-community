Those who feel that Africa has untapped potential which is not recognised globally; this is one you definitely don’t want to miss.You get to watch renowned international speakers on stage: The festival will have big names like Daniel Bergmann, founder and managing director at Stink Film (UK); Peter Grasse, executive producer at Dictionary Films (Japan); and Mbithi Masya, director at Fat Rain Films (Kenya) on stage, sharing their insights and knowledge with the audience.Play witness to incredible shortlist work judged by respected local and international jurors: All shortlist work has been judged by a jury panel comprised of local and global talents, including Alistair King (King James), Amy Allais (Ola! Films), Ralph Laucella (O Positive, US), Trish Russell (AMV BBDO, UK), Debra Stubbs (Groundglass), Kim Geldenhuys (0307), Yash Deb (Isobar, Kenya) and Antoine Bagot (Ogilvy Paris, France), among others. Now is your chance to see the work these great minds will award as finalists.Fill up your Instagram feed: As Ciclope Africa will be held at Cape Town’s new critically acclaimed Museum of Contemporary Art, Zeitz MOCAA, now is your chance to see what all the hype is about if you haven’t yet been.Get snacking: There will be an array of canapés and tasty tidbits available, so you’ll never go hangry.One for the gin fiends… Gin fans will be happy to know that leading distiller Inverroche is sponsoring the welcome cocktails, so you can get your drink on while you mingle.Meet your production heroes in real life: Ciclope Africa will play host to those talented directors, creatives, artists, and producers that you’ve always wanted to friend on Facebook, so now is your chance to meet them IRL.Networking your a** off: We all know that tired old adage; ‘It’s not what you know, it’s who you know’. Well, attending Ciclope Africa means that you will be sharing the same space as like-minded individuals who make it their life’s mission to excel in their craft – or work with those who do. Make sure you have those business cards ready.One of a kind: Unlike far-too-many adland festivals, Ciclope focuses on the art of execution, rather than the ‘big idea’. Whether it’s a TV commercial, a mobile app or an interactive installation, Ciclope believes that without expert execution, an idea falls flat… making it a one-of-a-kind.Afterparty: Ciclope Africa’s afterparty will be held at The Electric, a trendy new venue in Cape Town (behind Harrington Cocktail Lounge). DJ Richard Marshall will be on the desks, so bring your dancing shoes.Ciclope, hosted annually in Berlin, Germany, is the leading international festival and awards ceremony that recognises and rewards exceptional craft in moving image.
