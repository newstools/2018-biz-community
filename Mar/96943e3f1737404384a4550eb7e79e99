Snickers says the internet gets angry when it's hungry. The brand launched 'Hungerithm', an algorithm that analysed 14,000 social posts a day and adjusted the price of the chocolate bar accordingly. The angrier the internet got, the cheaper Snickers became.Ranked third is 'Reword' for Headspace by Leo Burnett Melbourne/Starcom Melbourne. The Australian youth mental health foundation, successfully tackled cyberbullying by putting in place a social media rewording tool that analyses what users type and uses a red line to strike through abusive phrases.Themes from the world’s top campaignsThree themes have emerged from the world's top campaigns for media excellence:Data is driving fresh media thinking. The top campaign is built around the smart use of data. This is a recurring theme in the rankings, as brands look to harness multiple data sources to deliver competitive advantage.An event-led strategy helps brands stand out. As brands struggle to be heard in a fragmented media landscape, there is a growing focus on 'events' such as Super Bowl, US presidential debates, and Olympics, that can draw a crowd and interest from the press.Partnerships are central to youth-focused media strategy. Partnerships with organisations or individuals that bring their own reach are now a key element of media strategy, particularly for brands targeting younger demographics.Top ranking agencies, networks and holding companies MediaCom London claims first place in the Gunn Media 100 agency rankings with four campaigns ranked in the top 100: 'Best Day Of My Life' for Shell (#6), 'Singing Our Way To The Top Of The Box Office' for Universal Pictures' Sing (#22), 'Missing Type' for NHS Blood & Transplant (#30) and 'Dark To Light' for Gucci Guilty (#77=).PHD New York is in second place also with four campaigns in the top 100.
