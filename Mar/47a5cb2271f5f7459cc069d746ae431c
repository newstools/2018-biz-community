Through issues of resilience focused on the larger discussion of the socio-economic implications of housing provision, WeTheCity considers that the future of our cities is practically the future of our humanity.”  Providing a highly participatory platform for envisioning scenarios of change, #AZA18 will host several activities that will question the nature of architecture in contributing to society and sustainable city development. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433928.jpg" alt="#AZA18: 'Future of our cities is the future of our humanity'" width="625" height="417">Reimagining the Pretoria Inner CityThe relationship between modernist architectural and urban heritage, the legacy of apartheid planning, inner city revitalisation and public space will be presented by Marianne de Klerk Architects & Urban Designers and Holm Jordaan through four integrated events – an exhibition titled ‘Pretoria Inner City: Formation and Transformation’, a seminar session titled ‘Modernist Heritage and Reimagining of the Inner City’, a walking tour and a Master Class.  “Vital urban issues such as the right to the city, the richly layered and often contested heritage of key sites, and the impact of informality and more inclusive use of spaces will be explored through these integrated experiences,” explains De Klerk.The seminar session will be chaired by Professor Hannah le Roux of the Wits School of Architecture & Planning, and participants include keynote speaker Professor Maria-Fernanda Derntl from the University of Brasilia as well as Dr Kees Somer and Professor Marieke Kuipers from the Delft University of Technology, Dr Emmanuel Nkambule from TUT and Johannesburg-based architect Tanzeem Razak.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433929.jpg" alt="#AZA18: 'Future of our cities is the future of our humanity'" width="625" height="417">CPD credits#AZA18 is hosted by the South African Institute of Architects and co-hosted by the University of Pretoria (UP) and the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT).
