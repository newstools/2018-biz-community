They were also joined by Lagos’ leading female tech influencers, who discussed the role of stakeholders and leaders in promoting diversity in the tech community. Taiwo Judah Ajayi, director of people at Andela, says: “A lack of a strong, cohesive culture is holding the tech industry back from building more female leaders and executives, which is why the leading women in tech need to start the discussions and ask how we, as women in tech, can inspire other women to be future leaders.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432776-120x120.png?2" alt="Applications open for Top Tech Tools for Women in Business" width="120" height="120">Applications open for Top Tech Tools for Women in BusinessThe ten-week 2018 Top Tech Tools for Women in Business course, hosted by the Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative, in partnership with the City of Cape Town, will kick off on 4 April 2018...12 Mar 2018“The aim of the Women in Tech Summit is to celebrate how far women have come in the tech ecosystem and to connect women in tech - both leaders and aspirants. The women interested in pursuing a career in tech are many, but the mentors and investors are few. Now is the time to have an open discussion on how we can stop our future leaders from slipping through the cracks. Today, we are building the biggest platform yet for women technologists and calling for more people to invest in tomorrow’s leaders.”Since launching in 2014, Andela has assisted in paving the way for women in the tech industry through its commitment to attracting and developing female talent. The company’s various initiatives include multiple all-female recruitment cycles as well as building safe and empowering communities for women in tech, such as Tech in Pink and Ladies in Tech.
