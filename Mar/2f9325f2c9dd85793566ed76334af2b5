Their commitment to fostering awareness of the theatre industry and their co-sponsorship of the Tony Awards, theatre’s highest honour, make them deserving recipients of this distinguished award. These two revered New York City-based organisations will be honoured with the New York Festivals Lifetime Achievement Award on Thursday, 17 May at NYF’s 2018 New York Show for their impressive marketing and creative communications efforts in support of theatre and actors in the United States. Breaking down barriers“The American Theatre Wing has been serving the New York and national communities for one hundred years, having been founded by seven suffragettes as The Stage Women’s War Relief as the country was entering into World War I. Since then, the organisation has focused on breaking down barriers, developing the next generation of theatre artists, and giving back to the community. As the founders and co-presenters of the Tony Awards, we are delighted that New York Festivals International Advertising Awards are recognising us with the Lifetime Achievement Award,” said Heather Hitchens, president and CEO of the American Theatre Wing. “Beyond the Tony Awards telecast and the Broadway season which reaches millions of people across the globe, the Wing provides a lifeline and leg-up to thousands of next generation theatre makers through grant programs such as the Jonathan Larson Grants, Andrew Lloyd Webber Initiative, and others. Additionally, through the National Theatre Company Grants and our Emmy-nominated documentary series Working in the Theatre, we help to expand the visibility of and access to theatre all around the country.” “Broadway is the longest street in America has never been more true. Our audiences around the country and the globe continue to make Broadway the form of live entertainment that continues to grow. It’s such an honour to be recognised by New York Festivals with the International Advertising Award. Like the advertising world, Broadway’s creativity goes beyond the stage, not just in Times Square but across the country and the world. Our job at The Broadway League is to increase that awareness and grow audiences,” said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League. Using theatre to advance human experience“It’s no wonder that for the past three seasons we have seen attendance top 13 million in NYC and almost 30 million nationwide. Between 85-90% of all seats are filled on Broadway on an annual basis. In addition to bringing Broadway to television and the internet globally through the Tony Awards, we welcome and nurture the new generation of talent and audience through programs like The Jimmy Awards and Broadway Bridges which encourage young people to take part on-stage, in the audience and behind the scenes. We are so proud to be in the company of so many creative organisations that have received this award in the past.”NYF’s Lifetime Achievement Award recognises prominent industry leaders and organisations whose accomplishments and excellent contributions have advanced the field of advertising, marketing and creative communications and made a lasting impression on the creative community.American Theatre Wing (ATW) invests in brave work, supports creative growth, and celebrates excellence to bring diverse stories to our national culture through theatre.
