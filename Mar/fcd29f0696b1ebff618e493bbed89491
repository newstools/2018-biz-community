It is through the mentorship and on-the-job training so enthusiastically offered by the hotel’s senior chefs staff that culinary teams benefit most meaningfully. “We believe that employees should also be given opportunities to showcase their talent and innovation on external platforms like the Distell Inter Hotel Challenge which recognise and reward innovation in the culinary field. We are excited to have The Table Bay represented in this exciting challenge once again and we wish our candidates every success as they unleash their creativity in the series of workshops and cook-offs that lie ahead,” says Joanne Selby, general manager of The Table Bay. The winning chef will enjoy a three-week internship with NH Hotels in Amsterdam while the winning wine steward will travel to London and then Scotland to visit Distell’s top distilleries. The overall winning Wine Steward will also receive a full bursary from Distell to attend the training courses from the South African Sommeliers Association. The Level Three SASA Advanced Sommelier training and examination is in conjunction with the ASI Diploma.
