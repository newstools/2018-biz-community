Consumer trends are identified by merely observing and noting the habits and behaviours of consumers in particular segments of the market. Consumer insights, on the other hand, are gained through a two-tiered process. The process starts by conducting research to collect data about consumers and their behavioural patterns. Then, scientific methods are applied to analyse and interpret the data and convert it into useful information that can inform business decisions. Simply put, consumer insights unlock the human truths behind the behaviour, or it explains the “why behind the buy.” Research and insights are only as useful as the actions they lead to, hence, businesses can fast-track growth by ensuring that for every 10% invested in research and insights, 90% ROI is achieved even if a decision is taken to take no action based on the findings of a study.Because the business landscape and consumer profiles have changed dramatically over the past decade or two, there are a number of conventional market research methods that simply don’t make the grades anymore.
