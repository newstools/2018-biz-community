"Today's milestone is an indication of how much is possible when we work together. Let's use the momentum we have gained to push forward with the Agenda 2063 flagship projects that we have committed ourselves to in the first Ten-Year Implementation Plan," he said.He said that the development was not the end but the starting of a new phase which, if successfully implemented around can turn the continent's fortunes.Following the signatures, African states will have to ratify the agreement in their respective legislatures to put it into effect. "The task now is to ratify the African Continental Free Trade Area and the Protocol on the Free Movement of Persons, so that they may come into effect as soon as possible," he said.When the agreement takes effect, Kagame said, it would have impact on the wellbeing of Africans as well as improve the quality of ties with the rest of the world.The agreement envisions a continental market of 1.2 billion people, with a combined Gross Domestic Product of more than $3.4 trillion. The agreement will also boost the level of intra-Africa trade from the current 14% to over 52% by 2022.President Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger, who has been spearheading the agreement adoption process, said that the deal presents a historic turning point with better days in sight. "As we launch the African Continental Free Trade Area, our belief is that Africa is stronger when Africans work together; rather than in a divided and isolated way. This is a strategy that we must pursue vigorously," Issoufou, who was also the first Head of State to sign the agreement, said.He noted that it would also make the continent an ideal international investment destination as well as serve to strengthen political, economic and commercial commitments with various international partners.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/423973-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How Africa can negotiate an effective continental free trade area agreement" width="120" height="120">How Africa can negotiate an effective continental free trade area agreementAfrican countries are forging ahead to complete negotiations for a continental free trade area between 55 countries by early next year...By Calestous Juma 2 Jan 2018The Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, urged African leaders to get on with the consequent steps to its implementation, saying citizens and businesses were eager for a stronger continent.
