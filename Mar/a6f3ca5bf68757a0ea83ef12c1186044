The industry came, they saw and witnessed as accolades were handed out to Isibaya, Tjovitjo, Lockdown and Ring of Lies to name but a few.“It is important to celebrate each and every person who plays a crucial role in the journey of creating the magic we see on our screens daily. Today’s winners are an integral part of translating South Africa’s golden stories into entertaining and thought-provoking conversation pieces. Congratulations to all the winners, we are extremely proud of the contribution you make to the South African film and television industry,” says National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF) CEO, Zama Mkosi.Night two, which will be on Saturday, will be broadcast live on SABC2 from 8pm.Congratulations to Apocalypse Now Now, Be Phat Motel Film Company for winning the Golden Horn award for Best Short Film #SAFTAs12 @seandrums pic.twitter.com/26cKpCumCs— SAFTAS (@SAFTAS1) March 22, 2018The SAFTAs 12 Night 1 Golden Horn winners are:Award TitleProgramme TitleProduction HouseBest Short FilmApocalypse Now NowBe Phat Motel CompanyBest Achievement in Art / Production Design - TV ComedyPuppet Nation ZACatherine Jacot- Guillarmod and Lindsay van BlerkBest Achievement in Make-up and hairstyling - TV ComedySes Top La 4Chantel NelBest Achievement in Wardrobe/ Costume Design- TV ComedyPuppet Nation ZACheney Van Graan, Geralt Cloete and Alice JacobsBest Achievement in Sound Design- TV ComedyPuppet Nation ZANeil BenjaminBest Achievement in Cinematography- TV ComedyPuppet Nation ZATonga IsangoBest Achievement in Editing- TV ComedySuzelleDIYAri KrugerBest Achievement in Original Music/ Score – TV Soap/TelenovelaRing of Lies 2Ngane SikobiBest Achievement in Post Production - TV Soap/TelenovelaHigh Rollers 3Kholofelo Malatshi, Bertus Kirsten, Brett Macdonald, Tumelo Mmatladi, Jeanette Mokobane, Sizwe Msibi, John Chaka and Theo ScheepersBest Achievement in Cinematography - TelenovelaRing of Lies 2Ntobeko Dlamini and Marc BrowerBest Achievement in Wardrobe, Make-up and Hair - TV Soap/TelenovelaIsibayaLebogang Lehasa, Sheila Petlele and Sebenzile MadondoBest Achievement in Art/ Production Design - TV Soap/TelenovelaIsibayaDylan Lloyd and Henrietta MoutinhoBest Achievement in Editing - TV DramaTjovitjoKabi Modiko and Ikaye MasisiBest Achievement in Sound Design - TV DramaTjovitjoBernard MasokaBest Achievement in Original Music/ Score-TV DramaIsikizi 2Murray Anderson and Phila MadlingoziBest Achievement in Art / Production Design - TV DramaTjovitjoEphraim Mathula and Vivienne MahlokoBest Achievement in Wardrobe/Costume Design - TV DramaDie Boekklub 2Ayesha Katieb and Jodi BowersBest Achievement in Make-Up and Hairstyling - TV DramaLockdownBabalwa Carol DjieutceuBest Achievement in Cinematography - TV DramaTjovitjoMotheo Moeng, Marius Van Graan and Ofentse MwaseBest Achievement in Directing - Documentary FeatureSkulls of my PeopleVincent MoloiBest Achievement in Cinematography - Documentary FeatureSkulls of my PeopleMarius van GraanBest Achievement in Editing - Documentary FeatureThe Giant is FallingHenion Han and Megan GillBest Achievement in Sound Design - Documentary FeatureThe Giant is FallingVaughan PhillipsBest Documentary ShortNanlaban: The Philippines War on DrugsChronicleBest Wildlife ProgrammeKing of the Mountain BaboonsEarth Touch (Pty) LtdBest Children’s ProgrammeXcellerate2 Blonds and a Redhead Filming CCBest Reality ShowWingin ItCheeky MediaBest Game ShowDie Kliek (S5)Afrokaans Film and TelevisionBest International Format ShowShark Tank South AfricaRapid BlueBest Factual and Educational ProgrammeOur MomentsDzuguda ProductionsBest Current Affairs ProgrammeEnviroserv: Kicking Up A StinkNGUNI TVBest Variety and Magazine ShowEdik van Nantes 2Meerfout filmsBest Youth ProgrammeMTV Shuga - In Real LifeTIA ProductionsBest Talk ShowRepubliek van Zoid AfrikaBrainwave ProductionsBest Music ShowStarlight ClassicsFreshly MincedBest made for TV MovieO Kae MolaoLeburugraphy PicturesBest Microbudget FilmNew Era SessionsRouge Music EntertainmentBest Achievement in Cinematography - Feature FilmBeyond the RiverTrevor CalverleyBest Achievement in Sound Design - Feature FilmFrom a house on Willow StreetJames Olivier, Simon Ratcliffe, Charles Singleton, Richard West and Andries SmitBest Achievement in Original Music/ Score - Feature FilmKalushiRashid LanieBest Achievement in Editing - Feature FilmInxeba (The Wound)Matthew SwanepoelBest Achievement in Production Design – Feature FilmKalushiChantel CarterBest Achievement in Costume Design – Feature FilmKalushiRuy FilipeBest Achievement in Make-up and Hairstyling - Feature FilmFrom a house on Willow StreetCharlene Warwick and Jaco Snyman
