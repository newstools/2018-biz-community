Two in a rowFor the second year in a row, Parmalat's 10-month Mature Gouda made especially for Woolworths, was announced the South African Dairy Product of the Year for the second year in a row at the Agri-Expo Qualité Awards Gala Dinner.“For a product to be chosen as Dairy Product of the Year in a competition of this nature is a long and difficult journey and the dream of every dairy technologist,” says chief judge and international dairy expert Kobus Mulder. “That the honour befalls this year's winner of the prestigious title for the second year in a row, is exceptional. Not only is it an extraordinary performance, but also a proof of sustained good manufacturing practices and quality control by the personnel of the manufacturer. Technically and gastronomically the Parmalat 10-months Mature Gouda is as close to perfection as a food product can come.”“This is the third time in nine years we have won the Product of the Year award for one our cheeses, a clear indication of just how high the quality of our products is and how dedicated and diligent our teams are,” says Cathy Eve, Parmalat SA marketing executive. 2018 Qualité Awards winners:Parmalat SA (7):Woolworths Matured Gouda 10 Months Woolworth Vintage Cheddar – WhiteWoolworths Matured Gouda 20 MonthsPresident Matured Gouda 6 MonthsUHT Low Fat MilkMedium Fat Yoghurt - Choc Chip Medium Fat Yoghurt - Fruited – StrawberryBelnori Boutique Cheesery (4)KabakaKalabashHighvelder ClassicTanglewoodBaris CheeseVliedermaus - Bloomy Rind with Vegetable AshCoega DairyRitebrand UHT Low Fat  MilkDalewood FromageBolandDutch Goat FarmGoat's GoudaFair Cape DairiesFull Cream Yoghurt - Vanilla Flavoured with Chocolate ChipsLadismith Cheese CompanyRound GoudaLangbaken Karoo CheeseKaroo Crumble<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434503-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Johan Ludolf (Parmalat SA), Selwyn Claassen (Parmalat SA), Johan Ehlers (Agri-Expo CEO), Eugene Swartz (Parmalat GM).
