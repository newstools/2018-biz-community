<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432977.jpg" alt="OFM is spreading the joy on Happiness Day" width="380" height="482">On this day, OFM will only play happy, upbeat music and all content will have a positive spin. That means feel-good news and sport bulletins, weather and traffic.  Our presenters will also do their bit to ensure that happiness is at the order of the day in their programmes. Listeners will also have the chance to win cool prizes, which will definitely generate feelings of happiness! Even the OFM Street Squad will be in on the action and will certainly put smiles on a few faces when they surprise some of our listeners with treats. Finally, making sure Happiness Day makes a lasting impression, OFM will fundraise for “smiling meals” to support vulnerable children in Central South Africa.  The station will work with Child and Family Welfare Free State, Northern Cape and North West by encouraging our listeners and businesses to pledge funds for this great cause.  Only R20 will buy a hungry child a meal.  Says Nick Efstathiou, OFM General Manager: “We celebrated International Day of Happiness on OFM for the first time last year and the day was a huge success! This year, we will build on the concept by introducing 'smiling meals'.  What better way to spread the joy than by feeding hungry tummies and putting smiles on the faces of children in our region? We are all very excited to be part of this fantastic initiative and I would like to encourage every listener and every business in our region, big or small, to contribute to this great cause.” International Day of Happiness was established on 28 June 2012, when UN Resolution 66/281 was adopted by consensus of all 193 member states of the United Nations.  It is celebrated around the world on 20 March.
