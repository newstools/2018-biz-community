The series of short videos feature Asilia’s newest camps and activities.For Asilia’s industry partners and agents, these videos offer an enhanced training experience on these two new properties, as well as the parks in which they’re located.For first-time safari-goers, the videos are an opportunity to “try before you buy” in an immersive and interactive way, whereas for more seasoned travellers this engaging experience gives an introduction to these new properties and the wildlife experiences on offer here.  “Virtual reality is the closest thing to being physically at a destination or part of an experience. It is an engaging tool that allows our future guests to be transported to places they have never been before, or have only dreamed about visiting but were unsure what to expect,” says Steph Binns, Asilia Africa brand manager.
