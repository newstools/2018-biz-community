There is a lot of potential in Zimbabwe once things open up and investors are assured of geo-political issues, the robustness of regulations and protection for investors,” said Michael Simms, mining and energy leader for global audit and advisory firm, Moore Stephens. Mining CharterMining companies, investors and companies working with the industry have also continued to welcome assurances from South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, that he is committed to finding a solution to the dispute over the Mining Charter and will consider the needs of all stakeholders and interests of industry and the country as a whole.  South Africa’s mining companies agreed in February to postpone a legal challenge to the government’s new rules for the industry, which they say are onerous and could cost many jobs. “From a South African perspective, clarity around the Mining Charter is the single biggest factor influencing capital investment into our mining industry.  By all accounts the uncertainty has substantially restricted capital inflows into South Africa and we have fallen behind others on the continent, We appreciate that President Ramaphosa has promised to give this a significant amount of attention,” said Olivier Barbeau, Moore Stephens South Africa mining leader based in Johannesburg. SustainabilityExpanding into the rapidly evolving sustainability space in Africa, which was a major feature at this year’s Mining Indaba, has also sparked opportunities. “There has been a big push into environmentally sustainable mining. This continues to be under the microscope and may make all the difference in managing, operating and developing a leading mine,” said Simms.
