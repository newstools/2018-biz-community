In my own experience, I'll see breaking news on Twitter that I only read two hours later on Facebook. Maybe it's indicative of my own media consumption habits but I think it's more than that. 280 characters with an average lifespan of 17 minutes – there is no room for fluff. Get the facts out. Say what you want to say. Ask the question you want to ask. Don't pussyfoot around or try subtly intrigue users to click a link they might like. Tell them they'll like it and tell them why. This is going somewhere. Bear with me.

Yes. In three weeks of two one-hour (give or take) sessions spread over five or six clients, here are some of the results: Between the six clients, Twitter followers have increased up to 25%. Engagement has increased by a total of 103% across those six clients. Overall sentiment has increased in positivity. From simple statistics, it is clear that Twitter for brands is essential. Why?
