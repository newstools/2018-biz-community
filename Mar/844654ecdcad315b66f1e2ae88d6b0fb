Appropriate infrastructure, health facilities, safety and security are some of the important aspects that make a city attractive to both talent and businesses.” <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434075-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Port Louis, Mauritius © byvalet –" width="625" height="325">Port Louis, Mauritius © byvalet – 123RF.comThe Mercer Quality of Living survey, which was first published in 1994, is conducted annually to enable multinational companies and other organisations to compensate employees fairly when placing them on international assignments.South Africa’s top three cities“Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg still feature in the top 100 cities, according to our quality of living ranking, making South Africa attractive to expatriates and multinationals.
