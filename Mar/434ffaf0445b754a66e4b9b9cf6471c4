At the end of the day, the network is only as good as its content. For this reason we see the value in offering a content service to our clients to ensure maximum return. The industry growth has helped us gain experience in more than just content animation and with this growth, Moving Tactics has established a specialised service in content strategy, content development and content analytics”.Moving Tactics Digital Content will be headed up by Ryno Colyn, who has 14 years’ experience in the digital signage industry in content strategy and development, play listing, scheduling, networks and installations. In the retail space, he has worked within Woolworths to develop and grow their in-store digital offering and has also established the content strategy for the Clicks and Clicks Pharmacy’s digital signage networks. Most recently, he has developed the content strategy for the MTN digital in-store network as well as developing content for their Brand and Touch channels. “Digital Content will provide an in-house digital content development team to produce bespoke content for all the departments within Moving Tactics. For our clients, we will specifically assist with the transition from traditional media to in-store digital. In-store digital signage content must be treated differently than traditional media content such as TV, print or radio. This can be a big challenge for a brand or it’s agency that is only used to producing content for traditional channels,” explains Colyn.Colyn, who joined Moving Tactics in 2014, has worked on several projects within the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry such as Famous Brands and the YUM group (Pizza Hut, KFC). Within the interactive field, he has created interactive touch solutions for short-term high impact installations for brands such as Adidas, DSTV (E! Entertainment) and permanent touch kiosks for Weylandts, Wimpy and the City of Johannesburg.And what is the secret to creating great content? According to Colyn, “It must be great visual effects and hours of animation, right? Although effects and animation has its place, it doesn’t necessarily make content great or engaging. Visual appeal will make you look but will it influence your buying decision? A relevant and measurable content strategy paired with well-produced content will allow for a solid foundation. The science behind content development is the ability to skilfully manage your content sources and marketing strategy in order to deliver on engaging, relevant and measurable content”.Moving Tactics is a leading South African digital signage solutions company that develops customised digital signage technologies and is constantly creating innovative communication solutions.Website: www.movingtactics.co.zaFacebook: www.facebook.com/MovingTacticsCTTwitter: @MovingTacticsSA
