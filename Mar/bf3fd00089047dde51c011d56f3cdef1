It is challenging ensuring that the other mature international offices within the organisation understand the extremely unique emerging markets that we serve in Africa. It is challenging, but also incredibly exciting, to create a worldwide understanding with regards to Africa. I am extremely honoured and grateful for the opportunity afforded to me to lead the Garmin Sub-Saharan team and to ensure growth and establishing the Garmin brand in every country we serve,” said Jennifer.Jennifer believes that the road to success takes hard work, dedication and passion – and this is evident in not only her professional capacity, but also in her personal capacity as daughter, sister, wife and mother.  Driven by her ambition, she knows exactly what she wants to achieve and has set out the relevant goals to do so. In the next few years, she would like to have Garmin become more entrenched in contributing towards offering tools that can assist with sustainability, a better understanding of personal health and becoming an essential part of their customers lives. “Our ‘vertical integration’ business model keeps all design, manufacturing, marketing and warehouse processes in-house, allowing us to maintain a high level of quality while also responding more quickly to the ever-changing marketplace.”In an attempt to better serve their customers, Garmin has launched a brand new Technical Walk-in Centre dedicated to serving their customers. “The Technical Walk-in Centre is part of our global alignment of serving our customers. No matter where you go, we are with you every step of the way. Our aim with this new dedicated technical customer walk-in centre is to ensure that our customers and their Garmin devices can keep moving forward, no matter what. Our technicians have extensive product knowledge and will provide face-to-face technical support and assist with trouble shooting. Some repairs can even be completed on the spot. Whether the customers require technical advice or support or looking for something new, at this walk-in centre we are ready to serve our customers in the manner they have become accustomed to receiving from a world-renowned brand. Customers have an opportunity to examine all Products and accessories at one facility.”This is just one of the ways in which Jennifer, and Garmin, are looking to improve not only the lives of their customers, but their employees as well. “This is truly a business that cares about the wellbeing of all associates. The company vision is clear and precise and built on trades that matter to me, honesty, integrity and respect.” “We are excited to follow the progress of Jennifer in her role as managing director, and to reap the benefits of her determination to better the company for years to come,” said Leenert van der Merwe, human resources manager, Garmin Sub-Saharan Africa.
