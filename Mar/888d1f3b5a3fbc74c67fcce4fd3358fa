OpenView is proud to announce a breakthrough deal with Kwesé Free Sports for broadcast in South Africa. Kwesé Free Sports, Africa’s largest and only pan-African free-to-air channel, will join OpenView’s programming line-up this March bringing premium African and international sports content to over one million homes in South Africa, for free. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433213.jpg" alt="Kwesé Free Sports joins OpenView's programming line-up" width="312" height="268">The demand for a dedicated sports channel on OpenView has been at the top of the OpenView viewers' requests, and the platform is delighted to have struck a deal with this dynamic sports channel. Kwesé Free Sports has established itself as a premium sports destination for every sports lover. The broadcaster has amassed rights for some of the world’s most loved sporting leagues such as the NBA – providing the most extensive content line-up available outside of the USA, Major League Baseball, Formula E, WTA Miami Masters and so much more. Open View’s head of channel acquisitions, Ziyanda Mngomezulu, is pleased about the new addition to the OpenView family. "Sport is one of the most talked-about subjects in South Africa and giving our audiences a new experience on the platform is perfectly timed. We have had requests for a sports channel since the launch of OpenView and Kwesé Free Sports is the perfect choice for quality sport from around the world that our viewers will love," says Mngomezulu. Speaking about the launch of Kwesé Free Sports on OpenView, Econet Media President and Group CEO Joseph Hundah said, “This is yet another significant milestone for us as we introduce another premium Kwesé platform to the South African market following the launch of Kwesé Play in 2017. This increases Kwesé Free Sports’ footprint to 27 markets. As a business premised on making world-class sports and entertainment content accessible, we are proud to deliver a dedicated sports channel beaming 24 hours of premium and in some cases exclusive sporting action.” Kwesé Free Sports is the free-to-air sports content platform from Africa’s newest satellite broadcast network, Kwesé TV. Although a relatively new player in the market, Kwesé TV has revolutionised the African media industry by offering a multi-platform content distribution network that encompasses linear, mobile and digital services. Kwesé TV’s broadcast network gives viewers unlimited choice to access content whenever and wherever they want, be it free-to-air TV (Kwesé Free Sports), mobile applications (Kwesé App available outside of South Africa), OTT streaming service (Kwesé Play) and pay TV (linear broadcast service available outside of South Africa). With the launch of Kwesé Free Sports on OpenView, South African sports lovers looking for a diverse mix of exciting sporting action will be in for a real treat. Tennis lovers will be enthralled by the kick serves, aces and breaks in the WTA Miami Masters, while baseball fans can watch Toronto Blue Jays second baseman and shortstop Gift Ngoepe make his mark in the South African history books in Major League Baseball. Motoring heads can get their fix of fast-paced racing action in the Formula E, while basketball fans enjoy every explosive dunk, high-flying hoop and sneaky steals the NBA season has to offer. There is something for every sports fanatic on Kwesé Free Sports and OpenView audiences will be spoilt for choice. Kwesé Free Sports will premiere on OpenView HD channel 110 on Friday, 16 March 2018, at 12pm.
