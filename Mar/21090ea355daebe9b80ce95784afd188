The government is also investigating expanding the goods exempt from attracting the tax as a means for assisting poorer households, but VAT is renowned for disproportionately affecting poorer consumers. Whilst many of Willowton’s products such as cooking oil, maize meal and rice are VAT free, there are an equal number of products such as margarine, soaps and candles that attract VAT.Moosa says the group will absorb the 1% VAT increase coinciding with the introduction of the higher rate on all its branded consumer retail packaged products, including Sunfoil, Crown, Allsome, Sunshine D, Romi, D’lite, Wooden Spoon, Cordon Bleu, Sona and Britelite range of products, whilst paying the 15% VAT rate to Sars.Challenge other FMCG companies“Willowton is profoundly aware that these are difficult times for consumers with high unemployment rates and escalating food and transport costs and this is our way of showing customers that we care for their well-being. We also challenge other FMCG companies and retailers to follow our lead in protecting the already hard-hit consumers of this country,” he says.The savings will apply to all Willowton clients and store outlets as the group effectively reduces its selling prices by 1%, whilst effectively allowing retailers and wholesalers to hold its ultimate selling prices of its range of products.
