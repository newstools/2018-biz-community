“It is fitting that this venue has been selected to host the official 50th Anniversary celebrations,” states the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority (MTPA). Founded in 1812, the Champ de Mars is the oldest racecourse in the southern hemisphere and the second oldest in the world. Located in the capital of Port Louis, the track held its first races in June 1812, the same year that British forces took over the island from the French. “156 years later, the country finally declared its independence here at this racecourse – and now today it is the setting for the country’s 50 years of independence celebrations.”Hand in handMauritius’ Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth underscored that what makes Mauritius unique is the creation of a rainbow nation that necessitated adjustment, tolerance and respect for different faiths and cultures. He stressed that it is therefore apt that the theme for this year’s celebration is La main dans la main, as all citizens have walked and continue to walk hand in hand to build the country as one people and one nation.“Mauritius, small as it is, is connected through the hearts of all of us. We learn from those who are around us and we respect the advice of the older generation in a way that shapes our own vision of how we should fend in life,” the Prime Minister stated.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432941-625x416.jpg" alt="Celebrations as Mauritius marks 50th year of independence" width="625" height="416">©Richard Van der Spuy via 123RFThe Mauritius High Commission to South Africa, based in Pretoria, also has an exciting programme of events to mark this historic event, launching the proceedings with a formal dinner to celebrate the Republic’s 50th National Day held at the Sheraton Hotel on Friday evening.
