They need help from their entire community to rise above their challenges,” explains Wendy Bergsteedt, Coronation Group head of marketing.  “Capsule equips not only the children with the training and tools to ensure better learning, but also their parents, teachers and principals,” says Bergsteedt. “By combining efforts from different CSI partners focusing on the same ecosystem, the children’s lives are touched by more than one of our programmes during the course of their school careers, strengthening their chances of success.”Impact assessmentCoronation will review Capsule’s progress twice a year to measure and assess the impact of the programme for the whole Capsule ecosystem. It will also run a rolling five-year anthropological study to measure the long-term impact on the learners and their communities.The programme is being piloted at three primary schools in the Western Cape: St Augustine’s Primary School in Parow, Sonwabo Primary School in Guguletu, and Vergenoegd Primary School in Voorbrug, Delft.
