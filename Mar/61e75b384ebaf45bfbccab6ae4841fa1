With water levels dropping it has become imperative to continue motivating Capetonians to save water on a daily basis. This is why Tractor Outdoor decided to partner with AUX Studio to get the message out there as widely as possible.“We are committed to raising awareness around the devastating drought which is currently crippling the Western Cape.  Trevor and Roy at AUX Studio have built an incredible app which updates itself real-time from the City of Cape Town’s drought data, and we have optimised our digital screens so that as and when this information is updated it is fed instantaneously across our network, ensuring that Cape Town’s residents are kept up to date with all the relevant information pertaining to the current crisis we find ourselves in,” says Simon Wall, managing director at Tractor Outdoor. TapOff’s public API feature allows the digital screens to make a clear emotional connection with Capetonians about the current overall water consumption, putting the city’s progress quite literally front and centre serving as a constant reminder to keep up with our water-saving efforts.
