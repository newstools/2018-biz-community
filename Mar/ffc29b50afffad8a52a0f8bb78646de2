Although Telegram later registered, it stopped short of agreeing to its data storage demands.Companies on the register must provide the FSB with information on user interactions.From this year they must also store all the data of Russian users inside the country, according to controversial anti-terror legislation passed in 2016 which was decried by internet companies and the opposition.Source: AFP
