"We are immensely proud and positive about our new shareholding, especially since it is a completely transparent partnership, bringing new ideas to the business and offering increased value to our customers," said Artifact MD Andy Taoushiani.  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434734.jpg" alt="#Newsmaker: Philasande Sokhela partners with Artifact SA" width="315" height="350">With a BSC in construction studies, Sokhela was working as a quantity surveyor but had been determinedly researching the possibility of beginning a promotions company when he started liaising with Artifact, and he's since brought a network of smaller suppliers and entrepreneurs to the table.

The creative nature of the industry is quite unique. There is just something there for me in actually creating new concepts, observing how they develop and how consumers actually engage with brands..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your vision to start a promotions company and how do you believe this partnership has created an opportunity for you to achieve this in a way?Because I have always had an appreciation for the creative arts and brand communication, I began trying to find a way to leverage the two together. I noticed that brands do not always communicate the correct message to the relevant consumer. Promotions deals with consumer interaction. This is where brands can create or generate brand love and loyalty. Artifact has now given me the springboard to confidently create these unique experiences with their know-how and experience having paid their school fees having multiple years working and dealing with promotions companies..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your view of the MAC Charter and how is Artifact now better positioned to do business under the new system?I believe the MAC Charter is possibly the fairest and clearest it has ever been.

I also intend on not only staying abreast of trends but creating and developing them. This distinctive trait will set us apart for brands and companies. This is currently one of my main focuses as well as ensuring clients receive more value and peace of mind for doing business with us..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work?I am currently reading a book called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. I love listening to podcasts so at the moment I have podcasts from Gary Vaynerchuk, Bruce Whitfield and I listen to podcasts from Africa Business Radio.Tell us something about yourself not generally known?I am a very stubborn individual; difficult to convince if my mind is made up. I enjoy reading Manga or watching Anime in my free time. I am afraid of heights and am generally family-oriented. I usually don’t take no for an answer and can be very persistent.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
