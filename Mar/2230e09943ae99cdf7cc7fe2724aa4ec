The ad features a modern South African family and comically depicts a curious little girl whose question prompts her proactive father to paint his mother’s house. The question directed to the father is “Why does granny’s house have wrinkles?” The result is a flawlessly painted house met with approval from her grandmother. “We’re proud to have come this far with the Dulux commercial,” said Fran Luckin, Grey Advertising’s chief creative officer (CCO). “We used Dulux’s Maxiflex technology which enables the paint to ‘stretch’ over tiny imperfections, giving exterior walls added protection to South Africa’s harsh climate. By comparing cracks in the wall to wrinkles, we allowed for the technical product benefits to shine through in a more emotive way. And that’s what resonates with people,” she said. The top 10 ads are rated by the South African audience, who Kantar Millward Brown believes to be the most important critic – as they ultimately choose whether to buy your brand or not.
