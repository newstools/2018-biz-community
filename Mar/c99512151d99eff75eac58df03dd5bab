This project is a continuation of Darkroom Contemporary’s mission of developing sustainable employment and skills development opportunities within the performing arts sector. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433355-625x417.jpg" alt="Darkroom Contemporary introduces In C and clone" width="625" height="417">A series of collaborative performances, interactive installations, educational workshops, and forum discussions have been set up as part of this event. In C is made possible by a grant from the National Lotteries Commission, while Clone is produced through additional support from the Centre For The Less Good Idea and the Western Cape Government’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport. These performances will include space for audiences to experience the project’s interactive motion sensor installation - a sonic playground where everybody becomes a dance maker and a composer, using their own motion to create unique soundscapes and movement phrases in real time. Created in collaboration with some of Cape Town’s leading composers, musicians and designers, this double bill consists of two dynamic dance works by choreographer Louise Coetzer, both featuring live music. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433356-625x417.jpg" alt="Darkroom Contemporary introduces In C and clone" width="625" height="417">Evolving from its ongoing campaigns to share dance with a broader audience, Darkroom Contemporary’s artistic director Louise Coetzer amplifies this mission to place dance at the centre of its urban, technologically driven landscape through In C, “I approach dance-making as a medium for narrative and connection - that of the bodies within space, but also with the aim of connecting dance as an art form to the world outside the studio or theatre, and to other art forms. In an age of technology, digital media and mass visual overload, my interests stretch towards allowing dance to interact with unexpected fields - especially those which seemingly have little or no direct connection - mathematics, science, computer - and digital technologies, physics and design.”Ticket infoTicket for IN C I DOUBLE BILL in Cape Town are available via QuicketTickets for clone at the Centre For The Less Good Idea, Jozi are available at lessgoodidea.com/bookings
