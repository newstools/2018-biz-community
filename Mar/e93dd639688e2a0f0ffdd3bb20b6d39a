“Research shows that up to 89% of traditional advertising content is now ignored by the consumer. Advertising can be skipped or muted, but attending an event or engaging with an experience is a decision. Science shows that the more senses you stimulate, the longer you will remember something,” Visser. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433500.png" alt="Hannerie Visser" width="300" height="450">Hannerie Visser.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Can you give us some background on how Studio H came to be?I started my career in the magazine industry at New Media Publishing where I worked for 13 years. By the time I left, I was the group publisher for a number of leading titles including VISI and Woolworths Taste. Today, I run my own design studio, Studio H, which was founded in 2012 - a multi-disciplinary design studio, specialising in experience and brand design. Our experiences are uniquely designed to manipulate the impact that science and psychology have on the senses to create long-lasting memories associated with our clients’ brands.Our client list includes, amongst others, Woolworths, Nando’s, Heineken, Visa, Moët et Chandon, the V&A Waterfront and our own projects such Chips! And the annual Streetfood Festival in Cape Town and Johannesburg, the Kids Food Studio and the S/Zout Future Food project, that included a series of waterless dinners.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433502-625x417.png" alt="S/Zout Future Food pop-up waterless dinner" width="625" height="417">S/Zout Future Food pop-up waterless dinner.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your philosophy when it comes to experiential marketing?Studio H’s approach is sensorial. We are in the business of creating memories so that people recall the brand associated with that memory for longer. It is a memory that creates brand affinity, and which — in the long run — leads to purchases of that brand.Globally we’re seeing a massive shift to experiential marketing because of the multisensory, immersive nature of experiences. Even digital brands are moving into the real world to create experiences. Google, for example, now hosts about 650 events a year in Europe alone.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433501-625x416.png" alt="Nando's media dinner" width="625" height="416">Nando's media dinnerThis is because it can take years, and millions of Rands worth of investment, to build real connections and engagement with people.

Food printing could allow consumers to print food with customised nutritional content, tailored specifically to their individual dietary needs. So instead of eating something mass-produced from the supermarket, one could soon consume something designed just for individual needs and tastes, on demand.We recently introduced the advances in food printing technology to local and international guests at the Business Insider launch at Design Indaba 2018, where Studio H was the food experience curator. More presentations are planned, notably for Discovery Vitality in March.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/413408-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Business of Design speaker Q&amp;A: Hannerie Visser" width="120" height="120">Business of Design speaker Q&A: Hannerie VisserBusiness of Design (BoD) is back with a speaker lineup of note.

We are also working on many client projects (we often sign NDAs so we can’t reveal too much). We’re already working on next year’s Convivium that’s taking place in June and we’re also working on a few Christmas campaigns as well. Our next event is a Waterless Dinner hosted for Earth Hour where we are teaming up with the V&A and Sun International – we’re designing glow-in-the-dark jellies for when the lights go out - can’t wait!www.studio-h.co.zasetTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
