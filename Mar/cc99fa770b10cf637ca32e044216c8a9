In 2015, Citizen Surveys started the South African Citizen Survey (SACS), which is based on face-to-face interviews with a nationally representative sample of 1,300 respondents per month on a variety of topics that map attitude and opinion in the country across politics, economics, social issues, food security and more. "We are very proud to represent Citizen Surveys for their PR and communication needs, and we look forward to working with their exceptional team," says Nicole Capper, owner and director of MANGO-OMC. Washeelah Kapery, CEO and founder, says, "Citizen Surveys has been around for over 15 years and we look forward to working with MANGO-OMC to share our data and knowledge with the public."
