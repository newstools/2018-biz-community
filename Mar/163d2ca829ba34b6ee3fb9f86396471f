Selim made his debut into the world of classical pop music after being signed to the international label EMI in 2012. He has subsequently released his album Cry For Love (Piango D’Amore). The 12-track album of contemporary classical pop music has been a work and dream that has evolved over the past 20 years for the Cape Town-born and raised musician. Next week, he has a series of shows entitled Love Story at the Artscape Theatre in Cape Town from 23-25 March 2018. I caught up with Selim last week. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432873.png" alt="#MusicExchange: Selim Kagee" width="300" height="450">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does music mean to you?Music is a way to experience emotions that cannot be felt through anyway else, it excites, inspires, motivates, and grounds me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the most enjoyable aspect of your work?Collaborating with other creators to produce something I couldn’t have done alone.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What drives you: ego or humility? If those were my only two options, I’d go with ego. Without its fire, I would find it hard to put myself out there and bear my soul. However, it's balanced by knowing what you ultimately like to achieve which is serving others in the end. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any funny moments on stage?Yes, I was trying to exit the stage after one performance in a musical, but I walked myself into a corner on the stage because I couldn't find the exit and I had to stay there till the next scene. Many years ago, I was in a play and we performed it to some high school students, I was backstage and the female actress was performing in quite a serious scene but the audience burst out laughing and we couldn't work out why. Then she came backstage only to discover her breast had fallen out of her costume.I also remember the time I was backstage during the performance of a show and I had my lapel mic strapped to my face and I went to the men’s room. The sound engineer forgot to turn my mic off and of course, the entire auditorium was interrupted by me relieving myself; couldn’t have been worse! .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}It’s your round, what are you drinking?Fortunately (or unfortunately) I’ve never really been a drinker.
