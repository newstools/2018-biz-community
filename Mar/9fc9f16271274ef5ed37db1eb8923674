We have to keep the needle moving to ensure standards are raised and global best practice is followed. By incorporating technology that allows us to seamlessly pull brands’ social posts into ad units in our network, across all platforms and devices, we are able to offer advertisers expanded reach in our brand-safe publisher environments without the need for additional campaign creative or messaging.”The SpaceStation and 24.com tech and product teams have implemented the ads in multiple formats including Twitter images and video; Instagram posts, video and slideshows and Facebook posts and video. The social posts are pulled directly into ad units and display exactly as the users would see them if they were logged into a social network, allowing users to click on the ad to like, comment or retweet.The advantages to amplifying social media content across The SpaceStation network include: social content amplification which allows brands to use South Africa’s largest publishing network to grow their following, branded content companion ads to run alongside advertorials, native content or sponsored hubs or CPM advertising for brand awareness or as substitute artwork for display advertising.“One of the biggest advantages to working with this new product is that we can help brands create a unified marketing message in real-time. Being a premium publisher, we afford clients brand safe environments with context, relevance and brand alignment,” adds Gustav.Visit https://www.thespacestation.co.za/polar-social-cards for a demonstration of this new solution.
