This exciting programme will not only enhance the skills levels in their organisation, but will also enable the Candidacy Programme graduates to apply for internationally recognised professional designations.”About the CILTSA Candidacy Programme“The programme is aimed at women who have some experience in logistics and/or warehousing operations,” says Harris. “At the end of the programme, these women will be able to add even more value and contribute to increased efficiencies in the workplace, as the theoretical and practical experience this programme offers will equip them with unparalleled learning and growth opportunities.”“We are all well aware of the enduring dominance of men in the transport and logistics sector in South Africa, and indeed globally,” continues Harris. “Partnering with TETA towards the professional development of women in our industry is a small, but important, contribution we believe that we’re making towards empowering women and enabling them to fill top positions in management and operations.” Designations recognised worldwide“One of the most valuable and exciting outcomes of this programme is that, once the candidates have completed the programme, they will be encouraged and assisted to apply for the professional designation awarded by CILT International, member (MILT),” says Harris. “These designations are prestigious, globally recognised and provide successful candidates with a significant competitive advantage. CILT can also award the designations of CMILT (chartered member), as well as FCILT (chartered fellow), once the candidates have achieved certain additional qualifications and experience.”Minimum qualifying criteria for applicants:MatricFemaleBased in GautengCurrently employed in an operations or logistics role with a minimum of five years working experienceAble to attend classroom training in GautengCompany must be a paid-up corporate member of CILTSAClear recordPriority will be given to equity targets: 85% of places will be allocated to black females (as defined)Programme provision and contentTraining will be provided by an accredited CILT training provider.“The programme, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2019, is both business- and industry-focused,” continues Harris.
