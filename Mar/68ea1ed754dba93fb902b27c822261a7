With 150 investigations under way, the board did not "have the luxury to drag out every case", he said."We will never deliver on our mandate if every case is postponed. In the current environment, there is so much interest in the audit and accounting profession. It is important to show the public that we're taking steps to address the issues."The Myburgh commission, set up by the Reserve Bank to investigate the reasons behind African Bank's collapse and headed by John Myburgh SC, made no adverse findings against Deloitte.The IRBA hearings, for which 27 days have been set aside in 2018, will resume on Friday.
