But watching a TV-style drama unfold on the messaging platform? That's new. Here's how Sanlam and agency King James got an innovative series rolling, on a phone near you...By Leigh Andrews 29 Jun 2017Speaking about using WhatsApp as a medium, he says it was a no-brainer. “It’s where your audience. However, you need to use the correct language. Digital does not allow for complicated language.” Tshepe adds that it a campaign close to his heart as he went through what the family in the campaign go through a few months before. “The campaign came from an honest place.” Intoxicating joy of being recognisedIn accepting his award, Alistair King, confessed that this was “quite a moment for me.” He told the gatherers, who gave him a standing ovation twice, that long ago at his first Loeries ceremony in Sun City, he learnt that not all awards are equal. “There are some advertisements anyone can do and then there are ones that solve a tough brief.” It is with the second one in mind that he co-founded King James and has approached his work. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1501/250697-120x120.jpg" alt="#BehindtheSelfie with...

The transformation of the previously disadvantaged brands, that’s my mission and it always will be.” Other winners include TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg in the Experiential category for their client Flight Centre for the campaign Babybot.
