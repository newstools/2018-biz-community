The board was carefully constructed to replicate a “frozen" billboard with melting ice and snow effects, giving the board a lifelike feel, and standing out in the DAR cluttered environment.“JCDecaux has some great and innovative OOH solutions that fit with Castle Lite’s personality - new, cutting edge cool innovations that have never been done before in this market. They met our expectations and even gone beyond that. The frozen billboard generated talkability and created buzz,” said Amou Majok, brand manager, Premium Brands AB-INBEV.
