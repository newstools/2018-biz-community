Johannesburg media weren’t left out and they enjoyed their avo inspired breakfast the previous day at Bolton Road Collection restaurant in Rosebank.  Recognising South African food writersThe Avo Ambassador competition aims to recognise South African food writers who have gone the extra mile to promote avocados and, as one of the judges commented, make people fall in love with avos all over again. SAAGA will be sending both Amy and Sam jetting off to Amsterdam for a long weekend, where they will get to explore Amsterdam and also enjoy a lunch at The Avocado Show – one of the world’s first avocado inspired restaurants.“I’m honoured to be chosen as South Africa’s avocado ambassador – my partner calls me Queen Avocado, so it’s quite fitting!” said Hopkins.  “I don’t eat dairy, so I am often looking for ways to get a creamy texture from alternative foods and avocados offer just that.” Raising awareness for local avocadosLinsell added, “I am over the moon about winning the prize and cannot wait to experience a restaurant dedicated to the avocado.  Apart from the amazing taste, I love avocados because they are so nutritious and their smooth texture allows for them to be used in anything from dressings to ice cream to topping a pizza.”The judging panel included Derek Donkin, CEO of SAAGA; Hans Boyum, Westfalia; Zander Ernst, Allesbeste Boerdery; Alta van Eeden, The Fruit Farm Group South Africa and Clive Garrett, ZZ2. “The Avo Ambassador received 11 entries which included print, online and electronic food media. We are looking forward to receiving the entries for this year’s competition and we thank the media for their ongoing support in raising the awareness for local avocados and the multitude of delicious ways they can be eaten,” said Donkin.
