BON Hotels adheres to a strict directive of only taking on properties where they can ‘add value’ and, according to Stehlik, the lodge is an ideal fit for the brand.  “Being five minutes from the KMIA (Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport), within close proximity to the Kruger National Park’s Numbi Gate, and being on the outskirts of Nelspruit, the location of this property caters to showcase the beautiful Lowveld across all market segments,” he explained. Attracting government business and international conventionsStehlik said that his group’s initial focus would be on the local and international Tour Operator market, the FIT (Free Independent Travellers), domestic and leisure market. The government tourism segment - local and international conferencing - will form part of the group’s immediate and future strategy as the property commences with a refurbishment of the current offering. The improvements include a more than doubling of the room capacity by adding 35 new rooms and a comprehensive refurbishment of the entire property.In addition to the immediate upgrades, plans are confirmed for the erection of a first-rate international convention centre. Construction of the convention centre will commence mid-2018 and will have a capacity of hosting up to 1,500 delegates, a first of that magnitude in the region. Stehlik said that the convention centre will “play an important role in attracting government business and international conventions to the area. There is nothing like this in Mpumalanga and we are very excited to promote this exceptional African experience and destination to a larger audience.”
