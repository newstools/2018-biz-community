Gender equality is the process of allocating resources, programmes and decision-making fairly to both men and women and is achieved when both enjoy the same rights and opportunities across all sectors of society, including economic participation, and their aspirations, needs and behaviours are equally valued and favoured,” says Suzette van der Merwe, Cell C managing executive: corporate social investment.
