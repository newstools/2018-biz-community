I started proceedings with the anti-inflammatory raw juice which consisted of celery, cucumber, pineapple, green apple, spinach, ginger, and turmeric. Pretty much the healthiest thing to cross my lips that day.The menu is split into six different categories; brunch, nibbles, bread, light, hungry, and sweets so we decided to share two nibbles as a starter. Settling on the Frito Misto, which is lightly battered and fried Oyster mushrooms, marrows, carrots, seed crackers and tzatziki and the fish cakes with creamy broth and caviar. Hands-down the winner was the golden fish cakes with delicious chunks of fish and the creamy yet delicately aromatic broth.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433042.png" alt="Somerset West welcomes new eatery Nom Nom" width="600" height="400" align="center"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433044.png" alt="Somerset West welcomes new eatery Nom Nom" width="600" height="400" align="center">Risotto loveFor mains, I chose the smoked tomato risotto while my partner chose the Cote de Beouf with truffle and parmesan wedges, hollandaise, and a small salad.The tomato risotto was full of depth, brightened up by sweet pops of roasted cherry tomatoes, plump mussels and expertly sliced calamari. The Cote de Beouf was equally satisfying, perfectly cooked juicy slices of beef paired with crispy parmesan covered wedges, how can you go wrong? <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433048.png" alt="Somerset West welcomes new eatery Nom Nom" width="600" height="400" align="center"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433049.png" alt="Somerset West welcomes new eatery Nom Nom" width="600" height="400" align="center">We felt we couldn’t leave without sampling one of the sweets so after a much-needed breather we ordered the Dulce cheesecake with caramel popcorn on the recommendation of our charming waiter. Served in a pretty sphere with a caramel coating and caramel popcorn this is one indulgent dessert, incredibly creamy and rich my only criticism is that it could have used a touch more acidity or salt to help balance the sweetness.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433050.png?1" alt="Somerset West welcomes new eatery Nom Nom" width="600" height="397" align="center"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433051.png" alt="Somerset West welcomes new eatery Nom Nom" width="600" height="397" align="center">Perfect for weekend brunching or lazy wine tastings Nom Nom is a welcome addition to the Somerset West area and food scene.Nom Nom is open 10am – 8pm Monday to Saturday.
