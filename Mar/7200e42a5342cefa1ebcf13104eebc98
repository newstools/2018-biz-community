So, when one says she has to leave to start preparing the evening meal, another reaches for her phone and the Debonairs Pizza app to order in a satisfying On the Double® meal, and – in doing so – giving her friend a much-needed break from the kitchen. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433549.jpg" alt="Debonairs Pizza sides with working moms" width="300" height="150" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433551.jpg" alt="Debonairs Pizza sides with working moms" width="300" height="150" rel="">click to enlargeThe 27-year-old brand targets males and females between 25 and 49 years of age living on their own or with young families and ‘The Mamzoz’ speaks to them all, not just the working mothers used to communicate its amazing value.“The consumer insight driving our strategy and execution for On The Double® is that, given the long working day so many of us put in, we often don’t have the mental or physical energy to keep on going once we get home and mealtime comes around,” explained Cameron. “Fortunately, with the great value of the On The Double® promotion from Debonairs Pizza, moms (or dads) can easily provide a delicious meal for their family to share without the hassle of cooking.”‘The Mamzoz’ flights on SABC, ETV and DSTV channels between March 13 and end of May this year but you can view the ad here:Credits:Client: Famous BrandsBrand: Debonairs Pizza On the Double®Marketing Executive: Toni JoubertMarketing Manager: Monica SitholeCreative agency: FCB Joburg                Business Unit Director: Mogani NaidooAccount Director: Kefilwe KhandaAccount Executive: Kaylyn NaickerChief Creative Officer: Ahmed Tilly         Creative Director: Greg Cameron  Copywriter: TJ Njozela   Art Director: Fezi Mpembe         Strategic planner: Stuart Sims and Katherine Anousakis  TV production: Tidimalo Mothlamme                              Media planners: Jedd Cokayne and Sulize Janse Van Vuuren - The Media Shop               Production companies: Darling Films and Hungry Films              Directors: Mzi Khumalo; Ian Difford                    Editor: Tessa Ford and Fuel Content                                          Post-production: Fuel Content
