P&G manufactures products like Pampers, Ariel, Always and Gillette. Funds raised finance P&G’s Children's Safe Drinking Water Programme (CSDW), which donates P&G’s Purifier of Water packets to deserving communities. Using only a bucket, a spoon, a cloth, and a four-gram P&G packet, families can purify 10 litres of dirty water in only 30 minutes. This is enough drinking water for a family of five for one day. P&G communications manager Jeanne du Plessis believes that access to uncontaminated water directly affects the economy. "Not only does clean water quench thirst, promote health and prevent unnecessary deaths, it means more people can go to school or work, and it enhances productivity. In fact, the World Health Organisation has estimated that every $1 (about R12) invested in clean water, sanitation and hygiene generates $4 (about R48) in increased productivity, which enables sustainable and equitable economic growth," she said. The CSDW initiative has created billions of litres of clean water in over 40 countries since it began in 2004.Game is encouraging all individuals, businesses and schools across the country to save water. The retailer's Western Cape stores are continuing to sell all water at cost, and have stopped selling portable pools until the drought is over, in a bid to encourage water conservation.
