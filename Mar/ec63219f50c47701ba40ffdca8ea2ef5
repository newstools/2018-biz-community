It hurts to watch that video… and that’s the point: we men who see it should be ashamed, and ashamed enough to change our abusive behaviour towards women.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/432959.jpg" alt="Asambe Nono makes women abuse a no-no" width="120" height="120">Asambe Nono makes women abuse a no-noWhen the #NoExcuse female choir sang Asambe Nono just before kick-off in front of 85,000 people at the PSL game between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates on 3 March, the words took the massive crowd by surprise...Issued by Ogilvy & Mather 12 hours agoCarling Black Label took it even further on 3 March, when it arranged for a group of women singers to take to the field before the start of the Soweto Derby between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. Before the packed stadium, they sang the well-known song, Masambe Nono, with the lyrics changed to tell the story of a woman who suffers from abuse after her husband comes home from a soccer match. Being under the influence of alcohol is not an excuse, a team losing a match is not an excuse.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433015.jpg" alt="Screengrabs from the campaign." width="600" height="390" rel="/c/1803/433016.jpg?0" data-height="390" data-lwidth="816" data-lheight="390" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Screengrabs from the campaign.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433018.jpg" alt="Screengrabs from the campaign." width="600" height="390" rel="/c/1803/433019.jpg?0" data-height="390" data-lwidth="816" data-lheight="394" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Screengrabs from the campaign.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433021.jpg" alt="Screengrabs from the campaign." width="600" height="390" rel="/c/1803/433023.jpg?0" data-height="390" data-lwidth="816" data-lheight="392" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Screengrabs from the campaign.The song hit home and many were the men in the stadium who, if they did not hang their heads in shame, were given pause for thought.A brilliant idea. A brilliant place to air it. And a real way to help the women of our country. It was also a brave move for an alcohol brand to take, because abuse of alcohol and abuse for women often go hand in hand, or should that be fist in face?1st for Women, the insurance company, did a similar thing, capitalising on that week’s episode of the hugely popular Grey’s Anatomy on M-Net, which saw the story of violence involving Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) and her abusive ex-husband, Paul (Matthew Morrison) reach a horrifying climax.This season of the show has been dealing with the issue of women abuse and, in the US, one episode title was changed to that of the National Domestic Violence Hotline in the US.Even though the show in South Africa still had the original episode title, 1st for Women took out ads during the show and a ticker tape, along with social media conversations, to promote its online platform, For Women, which features resources for abused women.Another brand using its clout to make a difference. And that is what genuine corporate social responsibility is all about.So Orchids to Carling Black Label and to 1st for Women.
