The FIC labelled the monies as highly unusual.Sars this week said Makwakwa had declared no relationship with NICS and did not declare that he had been a director in Biz Fire Worx - the company where the money ended up and which paid it on to his personal account.Makwakwa resigned as the revenue service was about to suspend him, a source said.Sars called a media briefing at Linton House, Pretoria, for 2.30pm on Wednesday.Source: The Times
