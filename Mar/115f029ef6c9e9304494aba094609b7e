As a team, they realised that they were having to subscribe to different CRM, project management, human resource management, collaboration and data analytic tools, which just didn’t seem smart. Data living across numerous apps that didn’t flow or integrate as well as it could, having to pay multiple subscription costs, working with user experiences that differed and having to remember so many logins just wasn’t on!The team soon realised that there were other start-ups, SME’s and even larger businesses who were experiencing the same frustrations. Yet, there just weren’t any solutions good enough to offer what they needed. So, the team decided to build an integrated platform that unified all of the functionality and features that each of these individual apps offered. By solving this frustration Unsilo.me aims at providing users with an all-in-one solution that has been intuitively designed to empower users to efficiently manage and scale their businesses. One subscription cost, one login, one user experience, full integration and flow between core functions and data residing in one place.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433079.gif" alt="Unsilo.me - Driving business growth through one unified platform" width="625" height="378">Unsilo.me is currently in production and the team are asking anyone who is interested in the product to sign up for early access to receive a 14-day free trial when it launches.Sign up for early access!
