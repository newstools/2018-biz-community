The public should not have to pay for this one man wrecking ball's legal fees," she said.Every single sent must be recovered"In addition to the R21m the Special Investigating Unit is pursuing in Motseoneng's debt to the SABC, this R22m must be added, making what he owes R43m."Every single cent must be recovered from him."Van Damme alleged: "Hlaudi left a trail of destruction in his wake. He flouted policy processes; demoralised, victimised and purged staff; brought the SABC's newsroom into disrepute and left the public broadcaster on the brink of collapse.""The DA calls on the SABC to personally hold Hlaudi responsible for this excessive amount of money, that can be much better spent on paying off its debts, investing in content development, finding new talent, informing and educating the public, and restoring the SABC's image as a credible and reliable news source."Source: The Times via I-Net Bridge.
