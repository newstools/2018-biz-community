I caught up with him last week ahead of his show at Café Roux in Cape Town on 22 March 2018.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433848.png" alt="#MusicExchange: Mapumba" width="400" height="429"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433849.png" alt="#MusicExchange: Mapumba" width="400" height="429">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When are you happiest?I am happiest when I am connecting with life. Physically, through emotions, and the mind. I need to touch life..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does music mean to you?Music to me means a beautiful way for people to communicate. Beyond words and cultures, which have their limits..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What drives you: ego or humility? I am driven by humanity..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any funny moments on stage?With my band in Johannesburg, we used to have big Afro-pop dance moments in our set. I would sometimes do the James Brown leg splits. One day, I did the split and my pants tore right in the middle. I had to run off stage..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Your heroes?Among the popular heroes are Nelson Mandela, Sting (Gordon Summer), Richard Bona, Rosie Mutene, Will Smith, and Papa Wemba..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}It’s your round, what are you drinking?Single malt, smooth and blood warming..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What makes you stand out?My music and performances represent a journey. Either through the continent of Africa or from Africa to the world. I feel not many artists can do that authentically. I feel I’m undefined by genre or category. This was a problem for me for a long time when labels and the industry required that artists remain specific to one. Now I am a veteran of that approach.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433850.png" alt="#MusicExchange: Mapumba" width="400" height="429"><img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/433851.png" alt="#MusicExchange: Mapumba" width="400" height="429">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Nicknames?I’m just Mapumba to the world. I have developed an act under the name of ‘Tshilombo’. It is an electronic live performance with a traditional twist. Imagine a singer/songwriter with more gadgets than just a guitar..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}If you were not a musician what would you do?I would be doing something technical. I like maths and I enjoy electronics. My ‘soldering iron’ would earn me some money then. Instead of just helping me maintain my old sound equipment.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Pick five words to describe yourself?Determined, humanistic, loving, energetic, socially-awkward. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your favourite word?Equanimity..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Favourite fashion garment?Hats..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}On stage, I tend to?Lose myself in the performance. I easily forget the formalities..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Wishes and dreams for 2018?To perform at high profile events and collaborate with artists that I respect (I missed my chance with Hugh Masekela unfortunately).Social media linksFacebook Page: facebook.com/mapumba.musicTwitter: @mapumbamusicInstagram: @mapumbamusicAllEvents (Live Show Calendar):  www.allevents.by/mapumbamusicBandCamp 9 (Online Store): www.mapumba.bandcamp.comITunes page: www.itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mapumbaWebsite: www.mapumbamusic.comsetTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
