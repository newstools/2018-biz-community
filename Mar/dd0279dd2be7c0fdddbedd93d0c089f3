They include brown bread, eggs and milk."We would like to stress that we are not looking for tinned fish to be removed from the basket of basic foodstuffs, but we believe that a review of this basket is long overdue and that chicken should be included," Astral CEO Chris Schutte said."Chicken is the cheapest source of meat protein in SA and now forms a large part of the basic diet of the South African population, with consumption at close to 40kg per person per year. "Not being listed as a basic foodstuff zero-rated by Treasury is questionable, especially in light of the fact that the consumption of chicken far outstrips that of any other meat as a source of dietary protein."
