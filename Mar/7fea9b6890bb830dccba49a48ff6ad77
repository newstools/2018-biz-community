"Moreover, advance indications provided by the manufacturing purchasing managers indices have also suggested a strengthening in domestic demand."FNB economist Mamello Matikinca expected a mild recovery for the sector in 2018 as domestic demand gradually increased.Seasonally adjusted manufacturing production decreased 1.6% in January compared with December. This followed month-on-month increases of 1.1% in December and 1.2% in November.Seasonally adjusted manufacturing production increased 1.8% in the three months ended January compared with the previous three months, with eight of the 10 manufacturing divisions reporting positive growth rates over this period.The Absa purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to its best reading in nine months in January as business activity recovered and new sales orders increased. The index, which gauges manufacturing activity, rose to 49.9 in January from 44.9 in December.Source: BDpro
