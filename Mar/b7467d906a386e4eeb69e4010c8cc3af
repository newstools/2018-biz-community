KPMG Zimbabwe is not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and, therefore, should not have been involved in the audit of the Canadian firm.Although KPMG SA had been informed that KPMG Zimbabwe was not registered with the PCAOB, it failed to follow up and analyse whether this would prevent KPMG Zimbabwe from playing a substantial role in the audit.In its ruling, the SEC said an adequate analysis "performed with due professional care" would have revealed it should not have used the audit work.On Wednesday, a spokesperson for KPMG SA said that when it identified the issue in May 2016 it reported the matter to the SEC.
