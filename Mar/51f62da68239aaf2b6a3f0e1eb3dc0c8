"It (the project) created an opportunity to test the idea that by reducing the amount of sunlight from reaching the corals in the first place, we can prevent them from becoming stressed which leads to bleaching," Marsden said.With its heavy use of coal-fired power and relatively small population, Australia is considered one of the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters, with advocates urging Canberra to do more to protect the environment.The reef is also under threat from the predatory coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish as well as farming run off.Marsden said it was impractical to suggest that the "sun shield" - made from the same material found in coral skeletons - could cover the entire 348,000 square-kilometre reef."But it could be deployed on a smaller, local level to protect high value or high-risk areas of reef," she added."The concept needs more work and testing before it gets to that stage, but it's an exciting development at a time when we need to explore all possible options to ensure we have a Great Barrier Reef for future generations."A report last year from Deloitte Access Economics valued the Great Barrier Reef as an asset worth AUS$56bn, which included its tourism revenues and indirect value for people who have not yet visited the site but know it exists.Source: AFP
