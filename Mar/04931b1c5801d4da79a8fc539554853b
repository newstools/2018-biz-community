In partnership with our client, Chicken Licken®, and their latest TV commercial for their Hotwings® product – the campaign “Sbu 2.0”, sees traditional above-the-line agency Joe Public set out to once again show the extreme lengths one goes in order to satisfy the craving. Because, when the craving’s got you, it’s got you!For the latest TVC, the agency worked with director Greg Gray from Romance Films, creating a quirky yet cerebral comedy about a science teacher who invents a robotic version of himself to fill in whenever the craving strikes. We meet S’bu, an unassuming science teacher who is up to something in his garage workshop late at night. We quickly discover that he has managed to pull off what could possibly be his greatest achievement ever. Using a mismatch of recycled metal and computer parts, he has created a functioning, somewhat autonomous, robotic version of himself. His very own S’bu 2.0. The advert plays out a variety of scenarios where the real S’bu has been replaced with his 2.0 version – confusion and chaos ensue. “With such a proudly South African client, we always try to create ideas that are relevant. We try to showcase real South Africans at the forefront of global playing fields in an entertaining and humorous way. So, whether it involves sending a South African to space, a South African archaeologist exploring an ancient Egyptian tomb or like now, a South African science teacher that has built a real-life, functioning, robotic replica of himself, we’re always trying to create a sense of pride and patriotism through our commercials,” concludes Martin Schlumpf, creative director, Joe Public.
