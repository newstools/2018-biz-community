While we acknowledge Floyd Shivambu’s formal apology, SAFREA, as an organisation that includes many freelance journalists, expresses its deep concern over what Mr Shivambu calls a scuffle, but Mr De Kock labels an assault. Physical violence and threats against any journalist or media practitioner while they are performing their duties are unacceptable and a direct violation of their rights. Bullying, threats and violence are deplorable forms of engagement that should not be tolerated in a democratic society. On the eve of Human Rights’ Day, we feel it pertinent to remind South Africans of the critical role that a free press plays in exposing corruption, highlighting injustice and holding those in power to account.   About SAFREA SAFREA is the Southern African Freelancers' Association. We advocate for and support freelance workers in the communications fields. We also provide resources, tools, training and networking to strengthen freelance careers.
