"Neither one of them can afford it happening again," he added.RCL had not responded to queries about industry co-operation by the time of publication.Tiger Brands representative Nevashnee Naicker said the company had not formally engaged RCL so far but it supported an "industry-wide engagement" to co-ordinate responses to the outbreak."Our focus thus far has been on managing the crisis and the recall, ensuring that we minimise the risk to consumers and engaging with the local municipalities in Polokwane and Germiston. We have been working with the local and international experts who have been brought in to support our investigation efforts. Furthermore, the teams have been involved with deepcleaning interventions during the week," said Naicker.On March 4 Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said that the strain of listeria responsible for most of the cases recorded since last January had been traced by the institute to Tiger Brands's Enterprise Foods factory in Polokwane, prompting an immediate recall of its products.Listeria was also found in cold meat products made in its Germiston factory.
