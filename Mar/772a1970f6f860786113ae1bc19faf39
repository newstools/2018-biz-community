The singles released thus far - Chained to the Rhythm featuring Skip Marley, Bon Appétit featuring Migos, and Swish Swish featuring Nicki Minaj - hint at the breadth of the musical and thematic elements found on Witness.Witness: The Tour is an imaginative trip from outer-space to inner-space, from the planets to the bottom of our oceans, and a musical journey through Katy Perry’s biggest milestones and mega-hits right up to her latest album. The dramatically original staging means that there isn’t a bad seat in the house.Witness: The Tour is Perry’s first run since the sold-out, 151-date Prismatic World Tour, which concluded in 2015 and was hailed by Rolling Stone as "a show to damage retinas and blow minds."Perry made her Capitol Records debut with 2008’s One of the Boys after signing to the label in 2007. She cemented her status as a global superstar with the follow-up album, Teenage Dream (2010). Prism, her 2013 album, debuted at number one on iTunes in 100 countries and has sold more than 12.5 million adjusted albums worldwide.The album’s singles - Roar, Firework, and Dark Horse - each surpassed the 10 million threshold including song sales and streams, and earned Perry three RIAA Digital Single Diamond Awards. In her 10 years with Capitol, she has racked up a cumulative 18+ billion streams alongside worldwide sales of more than 40+ million adjusted albums and 125+ million tracks. Perry is also the most-followed person globally on Twitter, and the first to surpass 100 million followers.Tickets go on sale on 16 March 2018 at 9am from www.bigconcerts.co.za.
