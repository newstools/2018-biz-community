For more of his views on this, read ‘Iqbal Survé funds scramble exposed' on Business Day.On this basis, Steyn said founder Iqbal Survé is already indebted to the PIC which loaned him the money to acquire Independent Media in 2013, and his response to this statement reads as follows:Dr Survé did not borrow money from the PIC nor did the PIC lend any money to Dr Survé. The PIC also did not lend money to the Sekunjalo Group. To infer otherwise is highly defamatory. To reiterate, neither Dr Survé nor Sekunjalo Investments are in debt to the PIC. All of Independent Media’s debt is from shareholders, who collectively have a residual interest in the business.This is a very different type of debt to that of a bank loan.In other reports:In his article ‘The curious case of Sagarmatha and the listing that never was’ on Business Insider SA, Bruce Whitfield believes: “there is something decidedly odd about the fact that the most-hyped planned listing on the JSE has fizzled out without so much as a fight.”Terry Bell of Fin24 says, “this should be a wake-up call to labour, a clear - and local - signal that a new age is dawning which, given existing economic and social systems, could tear apart the fabric of society”.Essentially, by investing in Sagarmatha, the PIC would be paying off the debt that Survé’s Sekunjalo consortium had borrowed to buy Independent Media, said Dewald Van Rensburg on Fin24. “A PIC investment in Sagarmatha would mean giving money to a company that would have Independent Media group, which already owes the PIC hundreds of millions of rands, as its major asset.”And so the unicorn died...
