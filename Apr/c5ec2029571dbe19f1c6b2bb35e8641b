What does this opportunity mean to you?Thank you. It means a lot to me as it’s a chance to get my brand out there but it’s also a great opportunity to learn more..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about this collection and why you think it made the cut?The Immortal collection will be by far my best work. It’s going to completely change RedThread from what it is currently. It will be like a renaissance for RedThread. It will give the brand its own identity. To be honest I don’t know why I made the cut. I was requested by a friend who is an up-and-coming designer based in Belgium, who also made the cut..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You haven’t been at Fedisa for long; what has been your greatest learning so far?I’ve only been there for three months. What Fedisa has taught me is that I still have a lot to learn. I am studying towards a Diploma in Fashion Merchandising..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}In the release you said, “My inspiration for collections hasn’t changed since leaving school but it has become much more complex, with a much more sophisticated thought process going into each collection.”Firstly, tell us a bit about your experience of starting a business or designing during your school years.When RedThread started it wasn’t a business. It was just me showcasing my art. I didn’t approach it as a business but when it started gaining popularity I had to learn how to manage a business, which I’m not really good at but a lot of people have helped me and still help me now.Secondly, where do you draw your inspiration from?My inspiration literally comes out of nowhere. I can get inspired by watching one of my favourite animals or by taking a walk and just looking at what people wear. All of that ends up giving me an idea of what to make. I also recently started checking out World’s Global Style Network (WGSN) which is really helpful. And lastly, how has your design thinking changed since commencing your studies in the field?My design thinking comes with steps now. First, the idea behind the collection and then, the message that I want the collection to send. Those are the two most important parts of coming up with a collection to me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What led you to start RedThread and a career in fashion?A friend, Clive Maqetuka, told me that I should start a brand, and I will forever be grateful to him because he has helped me a lot.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1706/395152-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#YouthMonth: Fresh fashion with RedThread Apparel X" width="120" height="120">#YouthMonth: Fresh fashion with RedThread Apparel XRedThread Apparel X, a fashion line started by three (currently still in) high school friends offers contemporary and fashion forward looks for young men.
