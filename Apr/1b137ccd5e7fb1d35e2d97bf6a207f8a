He reminds us of who we are, and what we are trying to do in the African advertising industry.”Simphiwe Pato, marketing manager at Campari South Africa, adds: “We have met the right partners, with the right attitude and the right understanding of how to help us achieve our objectives. We are quite ambitious about the future of Skyy Vodka in South Africa, and so working with the right partner is critical in helping us deliver against these ambitions. We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Kanbar.”Kanbar’s creative team are already based in Cape Town, and a management team will soon be appointed.
