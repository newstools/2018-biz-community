Not a one-trick ponyNicola Nel, MD of Atmosphere was very excited by the agency’s performance. Winning Campaign of the Year, and with two campaigns in the top 5 in Campaign of the Year, as well being the most awarded agency on the night, she says this shows that the agency is not a one-trick pony. “Year on year we have consistently delivered campaigns that have business outcomes. It starts with the brief by the client – we start by asking, what do you want us to do for your business and then we work the creative, often very closely with King James, as we did on the 2-minute showers campaign. She adds that part of this success is then “exploding this creative in all the channels. “PR lives in all the channels and integration is key.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437918-120x120.jpg?2" alt="2-Minute Shower Songs" width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: 2-Minute Shower Songs is Campaign of the Year!This campaign was an instant success, shifting the focus from a Cape Town issue to a collective national responsibility.

Matema is super proud of his agency. “DNA won many awards tonight. My individual award is the cherry on top and I am so proud. I have learnt so much in the industry, from what works today may not work tomorrow, to roll with the punches, and to understand your market and plug into that space.”  Clockwork Media received a silver for the second year in a row for Large Agency of the Year as well as three silver and two bronze Prisms. “The award affirms that we are on the right track, doing the right things, especially research and measurement, which is a key area for the judges, says Tom Manners, CEO of the agency. He adds that the number of entries in this category remains disappointing, however, and that he would like to this change. Plato Communications was awarded a silver in Small Agency of the Year. African Network of the Year was won by Burson-Marsteller. A silver was awarded in the African Campaign of the Year to ByDesign, a relatively young agency. As a new agency, these awards are so important, says ByDesign founder, Kevin Welman. “When we are recognised, it is alongside established players and their great work.” Coming of ageBridget von Holdt, convenor of the Prism Awards was named Lifetime Achiever. Earlier in the evening, opening the Awards, Von Holdt said she often asks herself why she does this. “Then when I see everyone gathered at the Awards I know why. I do it for you, I do it for the PR industry.”  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437863-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Prisms 2018 Lifetime Achievement winner, Bridget von Holdt." width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: Lifetime Achiever, Bridget von HoldtBridget van Holdt is all about working for the good of PR. This year's Lifetime Achiever, she has a clear vision for the long-term future of the industry. ..6 hours agoShe expressed mixed feelings on the PR industry. “The industry has come of age and is recognised in the boardroom and is respected for its strategies and the impact of its campaigns. We have brought the communication disciplines together and launched integrated campaigns. We see these campaigns in the Prism Awards’ entries and I applaud these.” However, she has two concerns – research and measurement. “Both remain weaknesses in what we do. We need to mature and move beyond per column cm as a measurement. AVE is not a measurement. It is for this reason that some campaigns did not win anything, while others were awarded. She adds that South African PR companies’ work is comparable to work overseas by their counterparts. “When I compare overseas work with the Prism Awards entries I see brilliant work and I am proud.”
