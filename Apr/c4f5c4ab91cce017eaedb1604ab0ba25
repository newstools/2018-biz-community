Table Mountain and a clear starry sky played a perfect backdrop to the concert proving once again that Kirstenbosch really is one of the best concert venues around. While support band Valve State with their laid-back instrumental electronica was a perfect mood setter, as the sun slowly dipped behind the mountain and the night settled in. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436387-625x417.jpg" alt="Morcheeba deliver with first live show in South Africa" width="625" height="417">It’s been over 20 years since Sky Edwards and Ross Godfrey formed Morcheeba and broke out with smash hit Trigger Hippie off their debut album Who Can You Trust, since then releasing over eight albums and many memorable hits. Trigger hippie lovin'Their arrival on SA soil may be long awaited, but it was definitely worth the wait. Vocalist Sky Edwards was on absolute point, her signature husky smooth voice never missing a beat while Ross Godfrey supported her excellently on lead guitar; a comfortable chemistry throughout. The fact that she was an absolute sweetheart, entertaining the crowd with interesting anecdotes and antics in between songs was an added bonus.

Impressive even from waaay at the back. What a queen! <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436388-625x417.jpg" alt="Morcheeba deliver with first live show in South Africa" width="625" height="417">Mix of hitsTreating us to a mix of hits spanning their two decade career such as The Sea, Blindfold plus a cover of David Bowie’s Let’s Dance,  and ending with the crowd's demand for an encore with hit Rome Wasn’t Built in a Day and Part of The Process, they were captivating throughout; reaffirming much love for the band as well as creating a host of new fans.
