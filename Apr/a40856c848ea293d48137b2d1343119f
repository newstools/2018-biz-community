OpenCo’s creative team of Kyle Schoeman and Nicola Sprawson invited Kyle to workshop the script with them. The piece is an ode to “those who tear normal up” – something Kyle’s become known for himself.   “BMW is a great example of why we’re so excited to represent Kyle for commercials,” says Colin Howard, Egg Films’ managing director. “Kyle is now getting opportunities to show his broader talent, with advertising as his main focus.” Kyle thanked everyone he worked with on BMW, including producer Will Nicholson, DOP Willie Nel, editor Jade Bowyer (PostModern), stylist Nola Williams, art director Gerhard van Zyl and composer Tapiwa Musvosvi.  Having made his name as one of South Africa’s most acclaimed music video directors, Kyle Lewis transitioned seamlessly into advertising with Egg’s sister company, Arcade Content, where his instinct and flair for African youth culture has been in demand with everyone from Absolut to Nike to Volkswagen over the last three-and-a-half years. Recent advertising accolades include a Gold Loerie and Silver Bookmark and Apex awards. Arcade Content will continue to represent Kyle for brand films and music videos; he’s represented in the UK by Black Dog Films - the music video arm of RSA Films (Ridley Scott & Associates), which also reps the likes of multiple Grammy and MTV VMA winner Jonas Akerlund.
