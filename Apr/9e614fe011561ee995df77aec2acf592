“Our decision to sponsor the event reinforces our approach that our clients are members of the Adclick Africa family and not sales statistics. They always come first and we are committed to creating value for them,” said Velly Bosega, Adclick Africa’s CEO. Besides the sponsorship package, the agency will also incentivise players by offering the winner of a hole-in-one competition at the sixth hole free advertising for their property for a specific period online. Included in the freebies is a comprehensive audit of the digital assets of all interested hoteliers. This SWOT analysis will help them refine their frontline strategies for more bookings. Adclick Africa offers proven data-driven hotel marketing solutions that drive:  Direct bookings  Revenue growth Guest loyalty Guest engagement Brand awareness The agency is the first one to put on the table for discussion in South Africa the contentious issue of direct bookings vs dependence on third parties. Adclick Africa hosted two very successful events last year in Johannesburg and Cape Town in which insights, trends and best practices affecting hotel marketing were unpacked by panels of high-profile experts. “As an agency, we focus on solutions that empower hoteliers to retain control over their revenue. We feel that it is unfair for them to lose a lot of their revenue to third parties who do not share with them debilitating overhead and labour costs. However, this is not the only challenge the hotels are facing. Third-party players are keeping guest data anonymous to the hotels and using it to promote their own campaigns,” revealed Velly. Adclick Africa’s hotel marketing experts will be on hand at the Golf Day to discuss with hoteliers. For more information about Adclick Africa visit www.adclickafrica.com or call 011 704 2641.
