This investment not only enables artists to thrive, but it also affects the health and robustness of investing businesses. Investment in the arts brings the benefits of impactful strategic thinking to boardrooms. It helps deliver better understanding of markets and market dynamics. It delivers collateral with which businesses may position their brands in an increasingly cluttered marketplace. And it provides scope for CSI interventions.“It’s our great honour and privilege to present these Awards for the 21st time this year,” says Andre Le Roux, Chairman of the BASA board. “Over the years we have seen how the Awards have grown and matured into what they are today: a reflection of a deeply committed corporate sector and of a creative sector that’s come of age as a viable and important component of the national economy.”The BASA Awards partnered by Hollard also showcase how the arts are a tool for bringing about transformation in its broadest sense. “Bringing the diverse, inquiring and questioning voices of artists to the corporate table enables meaningful conversations around what kind of a society we need to build and what corporates can and must do to realise this vision of a transformed, inclusive society,” says Heidi Brauer, Chief Marketing Officer at Hollard. “It’s these conversations that keep Hollard coming back as a BASA Awards sponsor.”Whilst awards are an important acknowledgement of the vision and application of their recipients (and, indeed, of all finalists), the value of the Awards lies also in the fact, that they spur the broader economy into deeper investment in the arts, says Michelle Constant CEO of BASA. “This effectively creates an inclusive South African economy, where the value of creativity in business is not only recognised, but also sought after and highly valued.”The Awards are open to all companies investing in or sponsoring arts events, projects or organisations in South Africa or Africa. They are also open to all companies investing in or sponsoring South African or African arts events outside of South Africa. There is no entry fee.There are 11 categories.
