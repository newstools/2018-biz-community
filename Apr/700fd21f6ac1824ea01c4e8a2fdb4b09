This is called the skills revolution,” explains van den Barselaar. Investing in learnabilityIn the midst of a Skills Revolution, when 40% of employers cannot find the skills they need and 65% of the jobs younger Millennials (18-24) will do don’t even exist yet, acquiring new skills and experience has never been more important to remain employable. An organisation’s success will be defined by the skill sets of its employees.“A person’s employability is no longer dependent on what they know, but on what they are likely to learn,” says van den Barselaar. Women need new skills, and they will need them more often, to remain employable for the unknown jobs of the future. This is why it is critical for leaders to begin investing in their employee’s learnability.

By ensuring that your organisation’s leadership development models can offer consistent upskilling and reskilling opportunities, corporate South Africa’s objective of the acceleration of working women into leadership positions will be realised that much faster,” concludes van den Barselaar.
