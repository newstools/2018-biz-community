Similarly, a parent from Eyethu ECD Centre said that she had noticed a marked improvement in her child’s language and social development. She has also noticed the improvement in communication between the school and parents, remarking how the practitioners are involving parents more in their child’s education.  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436384-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Woolworths invests R1.5m in water infrastructure for schools" width="120" height="120">Woolworths invests R1.5m in water infrastructure for schoolsWoolworths has announced a R1.5m investment in water infrastructure for schools via the newly launched MySchool MyVillage MyPlanet LoveH2O Water Fund...2 days agoAddressing poor performing ECD centresThe project aims to address the challenge of poor performing ECD centres due to ineffective governance structures and management systems. Practitioners are supported by a dedicated mentor to bridge the gap between study models and classroom assimilation.Practitioners who have graduated will also receive ongoing mentorship and coaching, ensuring that the knowledge and skills that they have gained from the training is applied in the classroom. Mentors visit participating ECD centres to observe lessons and ensure that content from study modules are effectively implemented. Assistance on how to improve lessons or manage challenging issues is also provided. A thorough baseline assessment was conducted on the ECD centres participating in the project, which highlighted the vast need for improved early childhood development facilities and competent practitioners to meet the needs of developing children.
