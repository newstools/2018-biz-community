It’s very important that investors know that talent is everywhere and that the way startups and tech entrepreneurs in emerging markets are addressing the underlying social challenges in their home countries, be it agriculture or access to finance, basic education, healthcare or energy supply is a tremendous business trend and opportunity.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436878-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Four African startups make Seedstars final" width="120" height="120">Four African startups make Seedstars finalFour African startups have been selected amongst the 12 that will pitch for the chance to secure a share of $1 million in funding at the Seedstars World global final today in Lausanne, Switzerland...By Tom Jackson 12 Apr 2018For Obirikorang, “winning at the Seedstars Summit will have an enormous impact on my company’s growth and success for the next years.

In emerging economies, we lack not only the infrastructure but also access to some fundamental tools like networking and mentoring.
