In fact, I was so inspired that I bunked the second morning. Not because I wasn’t interested in the Day Two speakers, but because Thomas Heatherwick’s talk on the first day compelled me to check out his latest architectural work: The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430901-120x120.jpg?2" alt="British designer, Thomas Heatherwick, on the Design Indaba 2018 stage. © Design Indaba." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2018: Thomas Heatherwick on designing with heart and soulFor most South Africans, Thomas Heatherwick has become a household name for his design of the Zeitz Mocaa in Cape Town. But there is so much more to this man, which he revealed in his talk at Design Indaba...By Ann Nurock 26 Feb 2018A visit without his insights wouldn’t have been nearly as rich. I would never have known, for instance, that the atrium was made by cutting out the shape of an enlarged mielie pip into the grain silos. And that, for me, is what Design Indaba is about: going behind the curtain, digging deeper and mixing metaphors to understand these damn design geniuses.Yes, I had seen and really enjoyed Khuli Chana’s One Source music video, but only when I heard the heartfelt story of its director, Sunu Gonera, did I appreciate the passion that went into it and its context of Afrofuturism. Sunu is a masterful storyteller, but his own story is as compelling as his movies. He told us how Clint Eastwood and Bruce Lee helped him escape the stress of growing up in a Zim township. During the civil war, he imagined the tracer bullets at night were fireworks. We felt his embarrassment when he couldn’t pay for lunch with Idris Elba in Hollywood. All these personal experiences made him, and his work, more authentic.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430297-120x120.jpg" alt="Sunu Gonera. Filmaker.

And thanks to Es Devlin, the set designer, I understood why. She explained that by projecting a close-up video of the singer’s eyes onto a giant screen, it amplified our most expressive language - eye contact - for an intimate, visceral connection. Combine that with the pop diva’s haunting voice and you can’t help but be moved.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438102.png" alt="Screenshot image supplied." width="625" height="329">Screenshot image supplied.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430780-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Es Devlin © image from the ." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2018: Es Devlin on moving from thoughts to words to actions, fastYou know you're in for a treat when the final speaker reaches the Design Indaba conference stage, they tend to save the best for last.

Not much to look at, right? Until you meet Lonny van Ryswyck. As she started her talk, she removed her shoes. The gesture was natural, endearing and perfectly apt as she’s more in touch with the ground than most. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430770-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#DesignIndaba2018: Seeing the world through a grain of sand" width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2018: Seeing the world through a grain of sandThe moment designer Lonny van Ryswyck took her shoes off on the Design Indaba stage, she opened many eyes to see the same thing in a different way. Isn't that what design is really about?By Jessica Tennant 23 Feb 2018Barefoot and pregnant with ideas, she explained how sand is a seriously diminishing resource and how each type has a unique and fascinating character. Who knew? One of her projects, “A World of Sand”, has sourced samples from around the world to reveal a broad array of the world’s colours and textures. Thanks to her, I saw this mundane material with new eyes.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438103.png" alt="Screenshot image supplied." width="625" height="329">Screenshot image supplied.Then there were death masks. Traditionally, these works record the contours of a person’s face at the time of their death. Neri Oxman, however, a professor at the MIT Media Lab, had a fresh take. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430809-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Neri Oxman, architect, inventor, engineer, designer, scientist and founding director of the Mediated Matter Group at MIT Media Lab. © Design Indaba." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2018: Neri Oxman is naturing our futureNeri Oxman, architect, inventor, engineer, designer, scientist and founding director of the Mediated Matter Group at MIT Media Lab, who spoke on Day 3, thanked Design Indaba's founder, Ravi Nadoo for letting her be "suntanned by the Mother City's spirit...By Sue Disler 26 Feb 2018Displaying colourful swirling patterns, her intricate 3D-printed death masks are informed by the airflow from a person’s last breath. Morbid, I know, but Neri was full of life as she enlightened us about her art. Some of the detail went over my head but she had a true zeal for honouring the deceased through memory. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438104.png" alt="Screenshot image supplied." width="625" height="312">Screenshot image supplied. Yes, the Indaba is about takkies made of algae, poetry written with computer code, and a melting Trump gracing the cover of Time Magazine. But it’s just as much about the thinkers who bring their ideas to life. No, I’m not a designer, but I am a human being. And Design Indaba 2018 spoke to me like one.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430655-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Aleksandra Gosiewski" width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2018: The next generation of fashion is biologyNew York-based Fashion Institute of Technology graduate and biomaterials research company AlgiKnit co-founder and COO Aleksandra Gosiewski gave a thought-provoking presentation at Design Indaba on Wednesday on why they, at AlgiKnit, believe that biology is the future of fashion and their revolutionary work in their search for a sustainable product...By Jessica Tennant 23 Feb 2018<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/430871-120x120.jpg?2" alt="&amp;quot;We were kings here.&amp;quot; - South African filmmaker, Sunu Gonera." width="120" height="120">Highlights and higher powers at Design Indaba 2018: The superheroes of designTerry Levin lists the highlights of this year's Design Indaba Festival...By Terry Levin 26 Feb 2018For more:www.designindaba.com
