We found the entries lacked measurable objectives, which made it difficult to assess the success of the campaigns.ROI was also referenced in minimal cases.  However, we saw a marked increase in the standard of entries – lots of great work. While there was some really good solid sound PR thinking in the awards, we would be keen to have seen some of the entries just push themselves that much further.Cluster 2<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437835.jpg" alt="Cluster 2 chief judge, Thabisile Phumo of Sibanye Eyezwe" width="250" height="243">Cluster 2 chief judge, Thabisile Phumo of Sibanye EyezweSectors:  Technology, campaign best informed by analytics and big dataPractices:  Social media for PR, mobile media for PR, best use of communication in a township revitalisation or education campaign, social media as a primary method of communication, social media as the primary method of communication (best use of social media to lead a programme with no social media spend, best use of social media as a support tool, social media to launch a new productChief judge: Thabisile Phumo – Sibanye EyezweJudges:  Ingrid Lotze – Puruma; Maritha Prichard – UJ; Dustin Chick – Ogilvy; Tom Manners – Clockwork Media; Cynthia Mabela – Eyezwe Young judges: Warren Mposi, Phushaza Sibiya IIIComment: The standard of entries submitted generally impressed and there was more depth in a lot of the campaigns, indicating that PR is being used more and more strategically to drive business goals.Cluster 3Sectors:  Investor relations, business to business (B2B), and sponsorship Practices:  Corporate communications, publications Chief judge: Ed Jardim – Murray & Roberts Judges:  Dave MacLeod – Game Plan Media; Anton van Rensburg – On Channel; Pheliswa Mayekiso – JSE; Kerrin Tessendorf – Bespoke Young judge: Khangelani Dziba Comment: Our cluster reviewed 23 entries and only six entries stood out from a creative, business objective and ROI point of view. Comprehensive research seems to be lacking in most entries each year and with many entries we battled to find the impact of the campaign on tangible business results e.g.: more sales, greater market share, etc.  Cluster 4Sectors:  Media relations, resources, corporate responsibilityPractices:  Internal communicationsChief judge: Daniel Munslow – founder, MCC ConsultingJudges:  Sharon Piehl – Fleishman Hillard; Andre Oberholzer – Sappi; Nicola Chaning-Pearce – Tynago Communications; Kylie Salmon – Beetle Inc Young judge: Nontobeko VilakatiComment: Overall, the entries demonstrated a solid business-as-usual approach to communication, with good planning and solid implementation. What could have been added to augment this good work is innovative thinking and cutting-edge strategic communication applications – the ‘wow factor’ of new ways of working and execution. Measurement and evaluation also could have been tighter, showing a direct correlation between communication and business results. While in some cases PR activations are simply aimed at driving awareness, more focus needs to be placed on strategic business outcomes, for example share price, overall reputation, and so on. Successful projects relied on an integrated approach, incorporating traditional PR tactics, effective social media that encompassed multiple assets, and an experiential element that engages stakeholders. Enhanced reputational equity is about engaging stakeholders as quickly as possible, and steering conversations towards favourable engagement.Cluster 5<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437856.jpg" alt="Cluster 5 chief judge Vicki St Quintin, corporate and healthcare consultant" width="250" height="250">Cluster 5 chief judge Vicki St Quintin, corporate and healthcare consultantSectors:  Healthcare, environmentalPractices:  Launch of a new service, product or categoryChief judge: Vicki St Quintin, corporate and healthcare consultant  Judges:  Thandi Moticoe – Purple Room Communication; Ruth Kolevsohn – Burson-Marsteller; Nicky James – Tribeca; Megan Outramm – Atmosphere; Carol Allers – Eskom Young judge: Wynand MonyesealaComment: It is always a great privilege to be a judge of the prestigious Prism Awards and to see the progress over the years. Entrants are taking much greater care in the preparation of their documents, following the guidelines and generally keeping to the word limit.  Amongst the excellent entries were quite a few that were not worthy of a read and reflected the most basic work. Many entries could have been improved by including relevant and original research. Most lacked the final evaluation shown against the hard objectives – all in one place makes it easier to read.The winning entries that we judged reflected more than ‘great ideas’ in the execution and showed real understanding of the client needs and challenges of the project. Excellent and concise writing remain the key to a winning entry, as we as judges can only make a decision based on what is included in the document.Cluster 7<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437842.jpg" alt="Cluster 7 chief judge, ByDesign founder – Kevin Welman" width="250" height="253">Cluster 7 chief judge, ByDesign founder – Kevin WelmanSectors:  Student campaign, PR on a shoestring, consumer PR for an existing product, service or categoryChief judge: ByDesign founder – Kevin WelmanJudges:  Ronel Rensburg – UP; Sonja Verwey – UJ; Corne Meintjies – UJ; Realile Tekateka - Engage Joe Public; Mandy Kojetin – AtmosphereYoung judge: Sanele MashininiComment: Overall, PR on a shoestring and consumer PR for an existing product, service or category were good. As always, there were excellent entries and entries that were average.  As an industry, we should be (and are) proud of the work we do, I think the two categories show the immense value good communication can deliver off limited budgets. In all instances, there was a great relationship between the agency and client, and great things were achieved together. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/435510-120x120.jpg?2" alt="2018 Prism Awards young judging panel. Image supplied." width="120" height="120">Prism Awards 2018 judging panelsThe judging for this year's Prism Awards has been wrapped up and the stellar lineup of over 60 judges alongside 11 Prisms young judges have deliberated on over 230 entries...4 Apr 2018Student campaignFor the second consecutive year, I’ve led the panel of judges in the student category. This year, we had a similar number of entries to last year, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality improve dramatically. The entries were all well written, the problem or opportunity was well captured, and the solution made a tangible difference. The only advice I would give students is to think more widely than social media – a Facebook post or a Twitter content plan doesn’t address everyone… don’t forget about the media; community, regional and national media are still critical. Please include channels beyond social media. Well done to the three winning campaigns, all three were refreshing and a joy to judge.

This gives young practitioners the opportunity to sit in the judging of clusters and experience the industry, while also giving them the opportunity to provide valuable input into the Awards. What did the young judges think of the judging? Khangi Dziba, Senior Brand Architect at DNA Brand ArchitectsThe process of judging the awards was exciting because we got to see all the amazing work created by fellow industry peers, but it was also quite intense; mostly in the sense that it required a great amount of thinking capacity on how the different campaigns presented impacted, shaped and made a difference in the lives of those audiences they were created for. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437147-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Khangelani Dziba" width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Khangelani DzibaIn the run-up to the 21st Prism Awards taking place on Sunday, 22 April, we chatted to this year's cohort of young judges about their fresh approach to the judging process...By Jessica Tennant 18 Apr 2018There was a lot of debating on why we chose to score the way we did and the insights we all drew from the campaigns. This made the sessions a lot more robust and worth all the time that was spent reading through the entries. Nontobeko VilakatiThis experience has been everything for me as a student, I have learnt so much from the different campaigns and what they actually really do and how they come about it. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437499-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Nontobeko Vilakati" width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Nontobeko VilakatiIn the run-up to the 21st Prism Awards taking place on Sunday, 22 April, we chatted to this year's cohort of young judges about their fresh approach to the judging process...By Jessica Tennant 19 Apr 2018I got to understand in depth the Why, When, Who, Where and How; and as a student you learn a lot from that, more of the practicality side of what I do in class.

Most of the entries tackled issues that I thought were really life-changing and educational and that was the point I raised during the final judging day, while defending them to be part of the winners. I really had a great time judging the Prism Awards.Floyd MagubanePersonally, I found it to be educational more than anything. It was a unique experience for me, so it was intense at times. There were a lot of campaigns to go through, but you learn from both the good ones and the bad ones. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437633-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Floyd Magubane" width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Floyd MagubaneIn the run-up to the 21st Prism Awards taking place on Sunday, 22 April, we chatted to this year's cohort of young judges about their fresh approach to the judging process...By Jessica Tennant 3 days agoFrom agency and client perspectives, you get to see in detail what goes into a having an effective and standout campaign. from the type of research to how the execution was carried out.

Overall, the whole process was a bit challenging but it was very insightful. It was a great experience. Simbongile NdlangisaAs a Prism Young Judge, I have been exposed to some excellent work by the most experienced companies in South Africa and feel I have a better idea of the status of PR in the country as well as window into how the PR world thinks. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437244-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Simbongile Ndlangisa" width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Simbongile NdlangisaIn the run-up to the 21st Prism Awards taking place on Sunday, 22 April, we chatted to this year's cohort of young judges about their fresh approach to the judging process...By Jessica Tennant 18 Apr 2018Simone Carter – lecturer: department of strategic communication at University of JohannesburgWhat an enlightening experience!
