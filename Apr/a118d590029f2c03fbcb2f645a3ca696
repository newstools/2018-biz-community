Legends like David Droga and Jeff Goodby will be joined by first-time speakers from Apple, Uber and Amazon in a programme packed with new formats that will really bring the big issues to life.”Creative Debates, Power Hours and New Directors’ ShowcaseNew formats this year include the Creative Debates which will tackle major questions facing the industry, including “Who Will be Your Next Boss?” Participants in this debate include Nick Law, chief creative officer, Publicis Groupe, Anatoly Roytman, managing director Europe, Africa and Latin America, Accenture Interactive, Emma Sharkey, creative director, Rothco and Jaime Robinson, founder and chief creative officer, Joan. They will interrogate and decipher the future of the branded communications industry and the players within it.Power Hours join the Forum programme and see three speakers deliver 20-minute talks all linked by a common theme. The Forum programme will also feature innovative game show-style formats, including a session led by Mark Earls (the ‘Herdmeister’), author and thought leader in modern behavioural and cognitive science in advertising. The programme will also feature more interactive and immersive sessions on the rooftop Terrace Stage, including a session with musicians Jessie Ware and Paloma Faith which looks at creativity and motherhood.Commenting on the programme, Philip Thomas, CEO, Ascential Events and chairman-Elect, Cannes Lions said, “The global creative community were very clear about what they wanted from this year’s programme: more insight from brands and more sessions that addressed the challenges facing the industry. We’ve dialled up on both these key areas. There are still lots of the familiar festival favourites, like the New Directors’ Showcase and talks from inspiring creatives, but this year’s visitors can enjoy more interactive sessions and specialist programmes that will equip them with business-critical knowledge and insight.”Creative leaders on stageThe Festival opens with a keynote session from Droga5 creative chairman and founder, David Droga, with a highly anticipated talk entitled, ‘Why the Hard is Easy and the Easy is Hard’. Other creative leaders on stage include the brothers Piyush Pandey and Prasoon Pandey, who are the joint recipients of the 2018 Lion of St. Mark, Goodby, co-chairman and partner, Goodby Silverstein & Partners, Chuck Porter, founder and chairman, Crispin Porter + Bogusky and Susan Credle, global chief creative officer, FCB.GLOBAL<img src="http://www.bizcommunity.com/c/1712/422577-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Piyush and Prasoon Pandey honoured with the Lion of St Mark" width="120" height="120">Piyush and Prasoon Pandey honoured with the Lion of St MarkCannes Lions honours brothers Piyush and Prasoon Pandey with the Lion of St Mark, the award for outstanding contribution to the creative industry...13 Dec 2017World-leading CMOs participating in a programme featuring more than 70 brands include Bozoma Saint John, Uber, Syl Saller, Diageo, Claudia Willvonseder, Ikea, Atilla Cansun, Merck, Elizabeth Rutledge, American Express and Jennifer Sey, Levi Strauss & Co.
