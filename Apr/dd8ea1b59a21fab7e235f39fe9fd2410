The theme this year relates to this as it is about energy reload for journalists.”Reloaded amplifies the need to reload trustReloaded, this year’s theme, reflects that the increasing role of journalists in building trust, loyalty and community, with news audiences demanding serious content that cements the relationship between readers and news organisations. “Reloaded amplifies the need to reload trust at every turn,” he emphasises.  The theme also highlights the importance of journalism. “Journalism is an important part of the democratic process of any country. It is the means through which individuals, communities and societies as a whole converse about issues that affect them. Every day journalists look out for issues, sometimes at great risk to themselves, that need to be told,” says Tsedu.  “It is through associations such as the Publishers Support Services (PSS) and institutions like Standard Bank, that society has the opportunity to recognise the input made by journalists and to laud them for that,” he adds. The theme also builds on last year’s theme where the focus was on the value and importance of journalism, in the context of a news environment where a breakdown in the trust between the media and its’ audience has occurred.
