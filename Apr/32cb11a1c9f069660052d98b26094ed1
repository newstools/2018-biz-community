For users, the breach of privacy, initially swept under the Facebook rug in 2015, has left a bitter taste in their mouth and the company itself was reported as losing more than $40bn in share value. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/436160-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Will business feel the after-effects of FB's data breach?" width="120" height="120">Will business feel the after-effects of FB's data breach?Gil Sperling, CTO of Facebook marketing partner, Popimedia comments on Facebook's data breach and what it means for advertisers?...By Gil Sperling 9 Apr 2018A recent survey undertaken by Campaign in the UK asked people whether they ‘trust Facebook less as a result of the revelations from the Cambridge Analytica scandal’ and a remarkable 13% had no idea what the survey was talking about. However, for 53% the answer was yes. The #deletefacebook tag that was initiated by the founder of WhatsApp, Brian Acton, flooded other social media platforms and initially hit a staggering 10,000 appearances on Twitter in a two-hour period. What does this mean for brands?So, what does this mean for brands? Some, like Sonos, have paused their sped on the platform to make a point, others have carried on regardless.  The #deletefacebook tag was something of a knee-jerk reaction. The fact that it has died down considerably over the past two weeks is indicative of that. Facebook does provide value to brands and it has improved how content is served to its users, but now is a good time to carefully evaluate exactly how Facebook contributes to your brand and whether or not the investment is of any value.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1803/434637-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Facebook runs UK, US newspaper ads apologising for data scandal" width="120" height="120">Facebook runs UK, US newspaper ads apologising for data scandalFacebook chief Mark Zuckerberg took out full-page ads in nine major British and US newspapers on Sunday to apologise for a huge data privacy scandal...26 Mar 2018If brands do continue to engage with consumers and provide them with useful marketing that’s meaningful to them, then they need to change their attitudes around how they use customer data. This applies to all brands, publishers and media owners – transparency is key and there is no time like the present scandal to clean up that shop window and adopt a transparent attitude. It turns out that old adage is true – tell the truth, or someone else will tell it for you.Data is currencyData has become incredibly valuable for brands and businesses, especially when it comes to marketing with accuracy and intent to the right target market. For consumers, their data is their currency, so ensure that your brand recognises and respects that. It isn’t owned by the brand, it is on loan for them to use with wisdom. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1803/434588-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How to avoid falling prey to a Facebook/Cambridge Analytica-type scandal" width="120" height="120">How to avoid falling prey to a Facebook/Cambridge Analytica-type scandalFollowing revelations that Cambridge Analytica exploited the personal data of millions of Facebook users, the social network is finding itself in a remarkably anti-social predicament...By Ilse van den Berg 26 Mar 2018If a consumer perceives that this mutual exchange is of benefit to them and that it delivers real value, then trust will grow.
