Correctly identify the famous DJ and stand a chance to win R65,000 in prizes in partnership with TOMS. The lucky winner will win sound equipment to the value of R65,000, which includes two Alto TS218 powered subs, two Alto TS215 powered main speakers, one Numark CD Mix USB, two five-inch studio monitors and two on-stage speaker stands. Says Nick Efstathiou, OFM General Manager: “TOMS is a great partner of OFM and we are privileged to launch this competition with them.  Music is our business and DJs are what makes music unique and exciting. We look forward to finding the next world-famous DJ right here in Central South Africa!” Listen to OFM for more info, or go to OFM’s website at www.ofm.co.za.
