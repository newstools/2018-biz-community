Full frame sensors are recognised for delivering excellent quality images and photographers are expressing interest in them. Over 40% of professional photographers anticipate buying a full frame DSLR and 17% of pros expect to buy a full-frame mirrorless camera in 2018. Meanwhile, according to InfoTrends’ 2017 US Digital Interchangeable Lens Camera (ILC) multiclient study, over 30% of consumers who are planning to buy an ILC are considering a professional model, many of which include a full-frame sensor.  InfoTrends also found that the decline in shipments of traditional digital cameras is finally showing signs of leveling off. Camera shipments in 2017 showed a small 3% increase from 2016. “This is encouraging for Canon as it shows that the market is now being supported by a core number of people who are dedicated to the art of photography, such as hobbyists and professionals. We are also very excited about the fact that people are keen to move on from their smartphones and smaller cameras as their go-to devices for image capture. “There seems to be a growing number of photographers who aspire to become professional photographers in the next year or so. This is an important segment of the market that Canon South Africa will continue to nurture through education sessions during our road shows so that they can learn more about the art of photography and get more out of their equipment.“Also as part of our commitment to nurturing aspiring photographers, users can engage with Canon SA on Facebook and keep up with the latest news with our Click magazine which is available on You Tube. Click magazine has information on all of the latest Canon releases as well as tutorials, case studies and tips. Users can also watch interviews with Canon’s experts and photography professionals,” says Michelle Janse van Vuuren, Marketing Director Canon SA.More good news for Canon is that, according to InfoTrends, mirrorless cameras are expected to continue to grow their share of the ILC market. Mirrorless cameras accounted for 30% of ILC shipments in Europe in 2017, up from 23% in 2016 and 22% of ILC shipments in the US, up from 16% in 2016. In each of the last two years, about 64% of new ILCs introduced were mirrorless models. The ratio of mirrorless models to DSLRs (almost 2:1) is likely to increase. Mirrorless camera features are evolving. Besides their size and weight advantages, mirrorless camera companies are introducing performance upgrades.Canon is recognised as one of the key innovators in mirrorless cameras and will be bringing to South Africa a new mirrorless range, with advanced features and enhanced performance, in 2018. In February this year, Canon introduced a host of new products for photographers, including the EOS M50, Canon’s most intuitive and technologically advanced mirrorless camera.“As InfoTrends stated, ‘…there has never been a better time to be an imaging vendor’. Certainly, we are dealing with a mature market but Canon is always searching for new niche markets. Globally, Canon is expected to see its operating profits surge in 2018, helped by its diversification into new fields such as network video surveillance. “Recently, Canon worked with FellowRobots at CES 2018 in Las Vegas to showcase how its advanced imaging sensors contribute with automatic intelligence and advanced algorithms to demonstrate fully autonomous robots using computer vision. These are indeed exciting times,” concludes Janse van Vuuren.For more information please visit www.canon.co.za or follow Canon on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn Reference: InfoTrends’Road Map 2018: Digital Photography Trends
