For young talent who usually don’t get the spotlight, Young Guns provides a global stage on which they can be recognised.”“One objective of The One Club for Creativity is to offer recognition and support for creatives throughout every phase of their careers,” said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club. “Young Guns plays an important part in our programming because it celebrates and elevates the next generation of creative leaders and serves as a lifelong network for winners who often reconnect over the years to refer work, collaborate on projects and help advance each other’s careers.”Program branding is developed each year by a past Young Gun winner. This year’s branding was designed by New York-based creative studio and artist representation agency Sunday Afternoon, led by Young Guns 11 winner Juan Carlos Pagan, co-founder and executive creative director.  Young Guns 16 and other TOCC activities are made possible in part through the generous support of sponsors including Levine/Leavitt and Shutterstock.
