This collection was everything Gert-Johan’s designs are known for. The show was breathtaking, it was filled with sequence, metallic fabrics, faux fur and the iconic McDonald’s golden arches. As the showstopper, McDonald’s breakfast ambassador, Nomzamo Mbatha, glided out in a beautiful red ballgown made by the design genius himself. “Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the McDonald’s Big Mac® – an iconic sandwich in South Africa and across the world, meant we had to do something extraordinary to honour this huge milestone. The collaboration with the designer extraordinaire was exactly the exciting edge for us. The fashion line is a celebration of the people that enjoy this iconic burger and the pop culture that McDonald’s, as a brand is a big part of,” expressed Daniel Padiachy, McDonald’s SA Chief Marketing and Communications Officer.This campaign showcased Pacinamix’s ability to come up with a brilliant PR strategy focusing on creating awareness and a newsworthy narrative around The Fashion Show with the iconic designer.
