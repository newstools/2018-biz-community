Like many other African countries fungal diagnostics are limited in scope to cryptococcal antigen (some countries), and microscopy and culture (very few countries). More rapid non-culture tests are not available, and this general neglect contributes to the 1-million Aids deaths annually worldwide.“Fast, accurate diagnosis is essential to reduce deaths from Aids. Gaffi’s modelling suggests that making the key diagnostic tests available for only 60% of needy patients, with treatments, could save over a million lives in the next five years. Our consensus meeting is another key step on that road, with later endorsement of the conclusions required by the WHO,” says Professor David Denning of the University of Manchester and President of Gaffi.
