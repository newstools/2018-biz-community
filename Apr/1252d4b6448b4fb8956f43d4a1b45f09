Unfortunately, professional videos can be expensive.”More effective ways of marketingMyburgh said the Chamber had set out to solve this problem and was now able to offer its members a huge discount of R15,000 for a three-minute video, bringing the cost down to just R6,500. This included a professional script, voice over and a day of filming.“So much is changing and the new technologies create opportunities for new products, services and businesses, but marketing is expensive, especially for small firms. At the Chamber, we saw the need to help our members get started or grow their existing businesses so we looked for a better, more effective ways of marketing.”“There is an old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words.
