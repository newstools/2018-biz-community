In a great collaboration over the past twelve months, the partnership achieved the following:  Grew Facebook fans by 259%.  Reached up to 13,500 people on Facebook per month.  Grew Twitter from 13 to 3,386 followers.  Reached up to 92,700 people on Twitter per month.  Launched a fresh and user-friendly website.  Increased quality lead generation by 30%. The firm’s content marketing strategy presents attorney-driven articles unpacking many legal subjects, and branded social media posts that visually present legal FAQs and facts of law that would appeal to the public. Both forms of content have resulted in positive engagement from clients and potential customers. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436501.jpg" alt="Brand inc celebrates one year of marketing legal-ease with Abrahams &amp; Gross" width="200" height="200">“Law firms generally feel unapproachable to the layman,” adds Heaton. “It was important to position Abrahams & Gross as friendly, professional and available, and to make the law space more accessible for everyone. By bridging this divide in public perception, the firm has grown its client base and it has positively affected the bottom line.” The firm has reported a three-fold increase in enquiries of which approximately a third lead to further consultation. Founded in 1935, Abrahams and Gross has been practising law under the iconic Table Mountain for 83 years. The firm is well known in Cape Town for its legal expertise in property, litigation, family law, business and immigration. “As consumers become more immersed in our digital age, it is imperative that traditionally slow-moving industries like the legal world transition with haste into a new model, one that is more user-friendly, agile and efficient,” concludes Heaton. “The success of this campaign demonstrates our capability in the digital and social media space with a results-driven approach. It has been a pleasure working with one of South Africa’s most esteemed law firms and we look further to collaborating further in 2018.”
