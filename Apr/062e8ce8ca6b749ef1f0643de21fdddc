Lynne Mackenzie, managing director of LM&P, says she looks forward to a new chapter in the evolution of the company. “We have delivered results-driven experiences for the past 30 years and are now in a position to further promote and expand our business with the invaluable support of our new partners.” Future profits from LM&P will also help to bring positive change to the lives of young people through education and employment in terms of the company’s partnership, inter alia through the Imvula Education Empowerment Fund and the LM&P Educational Trust. The latter’s principle beneficiary, The Maharishi Institute, provides free tertiary education and an internationally recognised degree to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
