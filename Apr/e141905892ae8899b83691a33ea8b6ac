We jumped at the opportunity to incorporate a Wakanda-inspired episode into our #BreakingBallet series. It features the indomitable Monika Cristina, Kitty Phetla and Claudia Monja as Dora Milaje warriors, laying down a challenge to any would-be adversaries of African culture. Why not book to see them live on stage in Carmen at Joburg Theatre from until Sunday, 15 April? Breaking Ballet is a partnership between Joburg Ballet and TBWA\Hunt Lascaris. Each ‘bite-size ballet’ is inspired by today’s big stories. The films live exclusively on social media, on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
