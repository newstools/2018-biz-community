We have over the past years, donated and installed more than 100 water tanks at needy schools across the country. Water is also a key focus of the Woolworths Education Programme, which over the last four years has presented over 4,500 water conservation lessons, reaching more than 190,000 learners and 1,559 educators in 410 primary schools across the country. We are also a long-term partner of Food & Trees for Africa’s flagship EduPlant programme which teaches schools various techniques to harvest and use water efficiently to grow flourishing food gardens.”To contribute, consumers should sign up for the MySchool MyVillage MyPlanet programme and select the LoveH2O Water Fund as one of their three beneficiaries. Every time a supporter shops at a participating retailer, their free card is swiped at till points or online checkouts and a percentage is donated to the LoveH2O Water Fund, at no cost to the customer. The LoveH2O Water Fund aims to raise ongoing funds so that more South African schools have a sustainable source of water.
