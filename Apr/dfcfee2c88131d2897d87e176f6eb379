I think we can learn from what those industries have been through but I think it's time for us to chart our own way forward as a continent.

The work we're creating is good. And the rest of the world is interested in it. Keep making.Please talk about the future of the industry and where craft is going.The world is changing and there are a lot more opportunities available to everyone. It means greater competition but I think this will only raise the quality of the work. It's up to us, the players in the industry to rise up to the opportunities presented and not cave into what's expected but keep pushing beyond that. I think it's an exciting time for the continent.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
