The spicy and aromatic dishes prepared by the Malay people were very quickly assimilated into many Cape kitchens. The Quarter Kitchen has spun these well-loved dishes into sophisticated gourmet fare.“The Quarter Kitchen has taken this popular and traditional style of cooking and added a bit of a gourmet fusion. The favourites are all in the recipe book as well – from daltjes and samoosas to bobotie and hearty chicken curries. The recipes are distinctively South African and something that every dedicated foodie should have on their bookshelf,” says Robert Hodson, general manager of marketing and sales at Legacy Hotels and Resorts.
