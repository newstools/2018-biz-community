Learners are also provided with accommodation, trade-specific tools and institutional training, plus full support which includes placement for the on-the-job component of the training. One of the most critical elements of the training programme, is that it emphasises excellence, to develop sound competence and help improve these learner’s chances of securing employment in the artisanal sector. ATI has no less than 35 plus years of experience offering quality technical training in South Africa with the institute training around 1,200 to 1,400 learners per annum. Since the inception of its donor-funded programmes nine years ago, working with the private sector, the organisation has already graduated 5,174 young learners through these programmes. An impressive 90% of these donor-funded learners have obtained employment by the end of their apprenticeships. “We therefore believe that this programme has the potential to substantially improve these learners’ chances of securing jobs in the artisanal arena,” enthuses Sean Jones, MD of the ATI. Jones further points out that the contribution each artisan makes to the fiscus over their career is roughly R4 million. “For the 5,174 donor funded learners trained to date, this is a staggering estimated contribution of close to R20,7 billion. This demonstrates the value of skilled artisans, not only to keep industry growing, but to the economy as a whole”.  “We are convinced that one of the key reasons for this high placement ratio, is the fact that ATI takes an uncompromising approach to excellence, with the aim to not only produce artisans to meet industry’s demand for technical skills, but to also produce artisans that are trained to the highest standards,” adds Mandisa Nyathikazi, Executive Director of the ATI.“Having witnessed the placement success of suitably qualified artisans first-hand, the logical next step for us is to promote crowdfunding for this programme. We aim to empower our youth with relevant skills to help redress poverty and youth unemployment. This contribution makes a significant difference while supporting industry and our country,” concludes Lewis.
