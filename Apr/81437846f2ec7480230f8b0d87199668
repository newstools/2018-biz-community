Flanking him is Tigo's corporate communications manager, Woinde Shisael (right).Tigo Pesa is amongst the first mobile financial services providers around the globe to be certified by the GSMA.   The GSMA Mobile Money Certification is a global initiative to bring safer, more transparent, and more resilient financial services to millions of mobile money users around the world. The GSMA Mobile Money Certification represents a strong proactive move on behalf of the mobile money industry, demonstrating its commitment to Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), and to delivering quality, safe and fair services to customers and partners. With over 690 million registered accounts globally, the mobile industry is making the world a better place, and mobile money has given millions of previously unbanked people access to financial services. Speaking during a press briefing in Dar es Salaam last week, Tigo’s chief officer of mobile financial services, Hussein Sayed said: “Tigo Pesa is proud of its contribution in driving the financial inclusion agenda in Tanzania by giving millions of previously unbanked people access to financial services. This certification is evidence that we have taken a step further to ensure that customers’ funds are in safe hands, and that their rights are being observed through our business practices and that a high level of customer service can be expected”.   In order to achieve the certification, each mobile financial services provider is measured against global industry best practice, and a pass mark of 100% is required. Certified providers are those that have proven that their business practices are amongst the best in the industry and that they are trustworthy and responsible financial institutions at par with the rest of the financial ecosystem. “Tigo Pesa is proud to meet the requisite criteria to receive the GSMA Mobile Money Certification. This not only demonstrates the quality and reliability of our services but ascertains that we are at the cusp of the digital financial revolution that is sweeping the globe,” Hussein added.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/404235-120x120.jpg" alt="Tigo’s chief technical and information officer, Jerome Albou addresses senior editors from Tanzanian media during the workshop on Tigo’s network modernisation initiative.
