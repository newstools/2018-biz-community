In the new role Utermark wants to elevate the conversation among senior and mid-level marketing executives about what mobile marketing can achieve in the boardroom.“Mobile delivers real business impact. From SMS through to video and app downloads, we’re seeing time and time again how effective a medium mobile is in reaching consumers across the income spectrum as well as across the continent, converting them from browsers to buyers,” she says.  Barely out of Q1 she’s already hosted the year’s first Thought Leadership breakfast. Its keynote was Arthur Goldstuck and guest speakers hold senior marketing positions at KFC, Uber and Standard Bank. “The MMA SA connects marketers, agencies, tech enablers and media sellers and advises how to create successful marketing strategies, learn where mobile lives within the organisation, and how internal marketing conversations have shifted to transform business. Our members have a vast amount of knowledge and insights on best practices, and they’re able to share with others. This is really encouraging and we’re fully behind enabling a collaborative approach to achieving mobile excellence in South Africa.”In May, Utermark will launch a Creative Workshop for mid-management in-house and in agency in the run-up to its annual SMARTIES Awards, “It will offer advice on how to create award-winning campaigns and learn from peers who have won in previous years.” Part of the global MMA, Utermark brings the best-of-breed research, intelligence and trends from across the pond to South Africa, “in as close to real-time as is possible,” she quips. The Smarties Business Impact Index for instance is the first and only global mobile marketing index that identifies, ranks – using a proprietary methodology - and awards top agencies, marketers, and brands that are leading the way in mobile and driving business impact. “There is an enormous amount of mobile innovation and creativity taking place in our country which trickles down to how brands and agencies engage consumers. But, good ideas aside, we’re most interested in what impact this has on brands’ bottom-lines,” says Utermark. “We are operating in an unforgiving marketplace where every piece of mobile content or creative needs to bring in the bacon. Our role is to help members deliver.”Visit www.mmasa.org or follow on @MobileInSa for more.
