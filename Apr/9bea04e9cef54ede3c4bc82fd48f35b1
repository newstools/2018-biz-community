The themeThis year’s theme is ‘Working Title’ and it was set to stimulate pure creativity in attendees. It encourages people to trade conventional modes of desert transportation (cars and motorbikes) for altered or even grotesque versions, with modified unicycles and old, decked out cars. Theme camps are sought to be particularly colourful, with surrealistic arrangements and the heavy use of textiles. Art installations should all be interactive and encourage onlookers to come for closer inspection, or even attempt to trade pieces for their own possessions.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436772-625x416.jpg" alt="What to expect at AfrikaBurn 2018" width="625" height="416">Performances are expected to be carried out by the attendees, who are both the audience and the attraction.Guest have creative freedom in providing entertainment for spectators, from chants to plays and think pieces. The set-up is yours to establish in the middle of the desert – just ensure it does not inconvenience other attendees.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1405/196082-120x120.png" alt="AfrikaBurn: Desert of Dreams" width="120" height="120">AfrikaBurn: Desert of DreamsTake a moment to think about the world you live in. Think about the vast-and-dense matrix of principles, codes and conventions that govern and maintain its fragile balance.By Brandon Williams 9 May 2014The campThe camp is divided into zones according to the noise level that can be expected. The blue zone is more tranquil and most appropriate for families, and the red zone is more vibrant, with frequent loud performances and the availability of alcoholic drinks.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436773-625x415.jpg" alt="What to expect at AfrikaBurn 2018" width="625" height="415">The last night of the festival is dedicated to the burning of the San Clan, a sculpture mimicking San Rock art, which represents unity and community. Its flames illuminate the sky and can be seen from miles around.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1305/132006-120x120.jpg" alt="AfrikaBurn: fiery embers of Tankwa Town" width="120" height="120">AfrikaBurn: fiery embers of Tankwa TownAll good stories should include a worthwhile journey and a journey to the arid semi-desert, mood-swinging Karoo is no stroll on the promenade. It takes preparation; it takes perseverance and, most of all, a high level of concentration.By Ruth Cooper 9 May 2013Getting thereThe event location will require you to drive on the longest stretch of road in South Africa, the R355 with minimal petrol stations with the last section upon a dirt road for over 113 kilometres. Most travellers opt for car rental for their road trip to the festival, sturdy 4x4s and bakies are recommended.www.afrikaburn.com
