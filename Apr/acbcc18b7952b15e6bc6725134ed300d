Significant achievementThe MMA BII ranks agencies, (media, creative and specialist), holding companies, agency networks, advertisers, brands and technology enablers that deliver the highest level of business impact through mobile-first campaigns from the entries to the MMA 2017 Smarties. The Index is based on the World Advertising Research Centre’s (Warc) methodology, the global authority on advertising and media effectiveness.  “This is a significant achievement for South African digital agencies and a testament to their ability to grow their clients’ business models through mobile. They have performed exceedingly well against their peers, outperforming most of the global players, highlighting that South African agencies are as well developed in mobile as their global counterparts. This despite the perception that these countries are further along the development curve when it comes to mobile,” says Sarah Utermark, country director of the MMA SA. “It’s an honour to be recognised on both the global and local stage, particularly when it’s for an organisation as prestigious and renowned as the Mobile Marketing Association,” comments Digitas Liquorice’s CEO and founder, Miles Murphy. “Each of our campaigns entered into the 2017 Smarties had different business objectives, therefore the impact varies.
