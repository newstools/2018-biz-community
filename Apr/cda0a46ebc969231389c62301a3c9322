You bet they would. Because it makes good business sense. In essence, integrated reporting is “an approach that helps businesses think holistically about their strategy and plans, make informed decisions, manage key opportunities and risks to build investor and stakeholder confidence, and help manage the organisation’s performance” - International Federation of Accountants.The beauty of following the principles of integrated reporting is that, in order to be able to report on your annual progress and standing in this way, you first need to embed integrated thinking into your organisation. These are some of the benefits companies have already been experiencing from doing so:1. The big picture transforms from a stick drawing to a work of artIntegrated reporting compels all the pieces of the puzzle to come together, slotting into place to create a unified and coherent whole. A whole that tells a complex story, that divulges obscurities and that sheds light around every corner and on every crevice. This holistic view afforded to management exposes all the information that’s relevant, that’s meaningful and shows the result of how it all converges enabling them to consider the organisation’s future viability and ability to create value.2. Value creation (or destruction) becomes crystal clearNow that the big picture is clear and easily decipherable, finding the value (or lack of value) is more straightforward. Although the integrated report includes financial information, this is not the sole form of value considered in compiling the report. Non-financial information provides context and a broader perspective for the financial information and the six capitals open up thinking beyond the numbers.3. The silos come a-tumbling down The word ‘integrated’ really does give the game away. Within the organisation a comprehensive approach to coordination across business segments, processes, information silos and internal groups is critical. You won’t be able to achieve integrated thinking and, indeed, integrated reporting without being fully unified and cohesive.4. Your measurement cuts the mustardThere’s an old saying that goes you get what you measure. With an integrated approach you’re guaranteed of separating the wheat from the chaff and measuring what’s important.5. No more fence-straddling or hemming and hawing Decision-making becomes a walk in the park when you’re measuring the right things and you have the information you need at your fingertips. Management understands the impact of decisions across the business and decision-making time is reduced.Want to know more?
