The campaign features one the world’s best Daniel Craig lookalikes, and depicts the "world’s slowest car chase" -  the police who are chasing the villain are Discovery Insure clients and don't want their drive points to be deducted! Adam Howard explains: "This was such a fun project to work on. I tried to capture the essence of a classic movie car chase scene that illustrates the visual story being told. We recorded a small orchestra to get that classic movie sound." The campaign rolls out on TV, cinema, radio and social media.
