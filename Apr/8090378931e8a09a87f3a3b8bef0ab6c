It’s about striking that fine balance between injecting modernity and retaining those heritage cues that carry the trust, recognition and credibility behind the brand, allowing one to attract the younger market, whilst still retaining the current consumers. The team drew from the brand’s heritage and consumer navigational insights to create a unified and contemporary product range. This successful relaunch places Cuticura at the centre of its more youthful counterparts and looks set to remain a firm favourite, passed down from generation to generation.
