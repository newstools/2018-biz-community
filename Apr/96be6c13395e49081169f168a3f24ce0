Encrypt. But what about the malware and ransomware that is just one careless and well-camouflaged click away? And the new cons everyone’s being caught out by simply because, well, they don’t know enough. Like the cryptocurrency scams.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/435906-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Don't spend another cent on cybersecurity until real risks have been assessed" width="120" height="120">Don't spend another cent on cybersecurity until real risks have been assessedIT security has become a business necessity against the backdrop of proliferating threats from the web, malware and cyber extortion...By Charl Ueckermann 6 Apr 2018While every business will have policies and controls in place on the corporate network, there is very little they can do about staff using technology in their homes and in their everyday interactions. The bugs, malware and Trojans they pick up can and do enter the enterprise.  There are simply no boundaries anymore.The answer? Education.Businesses have to start educating technology users, not just protect the business.Security policiesThere is no all-for-one security policy that works any longer. A security policy must be highly relevant to the organisation. The injunctions are simple:Understand the technology.Understand the risk.Put the right policy in place for your business. There is, unfortunately, no winning formula. Nor can businesses simply put in security requirements for the sake of ticking a box anymore.Accepted levels of risk need to be defined and the security policy and rules must be practical and enforceable.The security at any organisation will depend on the systems in use. Enterprises need to identify entry points to their networks and put endpoint protection in place, control access to and monitor traffic on these networks, sweeping networks clean regularly. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1803/434588-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How to avoid falling prey to a Facebook/Cambridge Analytica-type scandal" width="120" height="120">How to avoid falling prey to a Facebook/Cambridge Analytica-type scandalFollowing revelations that Cambridge Analytica exploited the personal data of millions of Facebook users, the social network is finding itself in a remarkably anti-social predicament...By Ilse van den Berg 26 Mar 2018The enterprise must also ensure the security circle is closed, putting alerts in place and acting on those alerts, staying ahead of new and emerging threats and enforcing basic safeguards, such as ensuring users implement anti-malware on their phones.As the extent of our digital exposure and vulnerability continues to unfold, it’s clear that businesses need to take more responsibility for educating its users.The rights and privileges we give digital platforms and applications, like Facebook and others, are being exploited in unexpected and surprising ways. It’s time we wised up – there are very few benevolent providers of free apps and functionality. The digital world is in its infancy and there are untold and as yet unknown ways in which our data and our online behaviour can be manipulated and cashed in on. Companies have a lot to lose — it’s time to ensure everyone takes responsibility for putting the basics in place.
