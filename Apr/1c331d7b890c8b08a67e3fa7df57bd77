Therefore, the number of awarded entries fluctuates year to year. Some years no Black Pencils are awarded: the record currently stands at seven. Traditionally the toughest of the awards shows, the judging process is famously rigorous, with the juries only selecting work they believe is truly exceptional. The value of creativity to business D&AD CEO Tim Lindsay commented: “The last few days of judging have been incredibly inspiring, and we’re excited to open our doors today for this year’s Festival. All Pencil winning work is on show throughout the Truman Brewery, and will give visitors an insight into what creative excellence means today. It’s great to see the range of work that creative minds all over the globe are producing. Long gone are the days when design and advertising operated in silos. The work being produced today touches many industries and is a testament to the value of creativity to business.”Country ranking by number of Pencils won:Ranking (by number of Pencils)CountryNumber of Pencils1United States1942United Kingdom1653Japan494Germany465France376Australia317Brazil258New Zealand219Singapore1510Sweden1411Canada1112Netherlands10=13China9=13India915United Arab Emirates8=16Norway6=16South Africa6=18Poland5=18Switzerland5=18Thailand5=21Argentina4=21Denmark4=21Hong Kong4=21Italy4=21Lithuania4=21Russian Federation4=21Spain4=28Egypt3=28Ireland3=30Belgium2=30Hungary2=30Korea, Republic of2=30Malaysia2=30Taiwan2=35Belarus1=35Colombia1=35Greece1=35Indonesia1=35Mexico1=35Portugal1All the winners CategoryEntry NameEntrant CompanyPrimary ClientCountryArt Direction for Digital MarketingFree Democrats "The Dark Diaries“Heimat, BerlinFree Democratic PartyGermanyArt Direction for Digital MarketingiPhone People Talking Pixel 2Google Creative LabGoogleUnited KingdomArt Direction for DirectJohnsonville - Made the Johnsonville Way (Guess the Price of that Food)Droga5JohnsonvilleUnited StatesArt Direction for DirectOne Book for PeaceY&R DubaiInterreligious Council in Bosnia & HerzegovinaUnited Arab EmiratesArt Direction for Enhanced Poster AdvertisingGame of Thrones "Tapestry"Tourism IrelandTourism IrelandUnited KingdomArt Direction for Film AdvertisingChristie's - The Last da VinciDroga5Christie'sUnited StatesArt Direction for Film AdvertisingLabel of LoveRosaparkMonoprixFranceArt Direction for Film AdvertisingNew York Times - Dedicated JournalistDroga5The New York TimesUnited StatesArt Direction for Film AdvertisingOriginal Is Never FinishedJohannes Leonardoadidas OriginalsUnited StatesArt Direction for Film AdvertisingThe Fearless Are HereY&R LondonBBCUnited KingdomArt Direction for Film AdvertisingThe Great British Bake Off4creativeChannel 4United KingdomArt Direction for Film AdvertisingThe Lost NightFCB New ZealandHealth Promotion AgencyNew ZealandArt Direction for Film AdvertisingWelcome HomeTBWA\Media Arts LabAppleUnited StatesArt Direction for Poster AdvertisingDTFWieden+Kennedy New YorkOkCupidUnited StatesArt Direction for Poster AdvertisingIn the World of Play-DohDDB ParisHasbroFranceArt Direction for Poster AdvertisingLISB-ONPartnersLISB-ONPortugalArt Direction for Poster AdvertisingRed Bull Music Festival TokyoMoriRed BullJapanArt Direction for Press AdvertisingBlock Out the Chaos: Babies / Dogs / Wife & DaughterCheil Worldwide, Hong KongJBLHong KongArt Direction for Press AdvertisingHostage of MemoryF/Nazca Saatchi & SaatchiLeicaBrazilArt Direction for Press AdvertisingNow in Fruit FlavoursGreynJ UnitedFerreroThailandArt Direction for Press AdvertisingSumo Girls 82 TechniquesDentsuHokkoku ShimbunJapanChildren's & Young Adult BooksPenguin Frozen StorybookTBWA\\ShanghaiPenguin BooksChinaChildren's & Young Adult BooksThe Folio Society edition of 'The Hundred and One Dalmatians' by Dodie SmithThe Folio SocietyThe Folio SocietyUnited KingdomCulture, Art & Design BooksBalanciaga, l'œuvre au noirMuchoParis MuséesFranceCulture, Art & Design BooksNGV TriennialNational Gallery of VictoriaPublicAustraliaCulture, Art & Design BooksProud of Lithuania: A Fairy Tale by Sweet RootBoy Creative StudioSweet RootLithuaniaCulture, Art & Design BooksTalk about KunquQu Minmin & Jiang QianJiangsu Phoenix Fine Arts Publishing.LtdChinaCulture, Art & Design BooksTerremotoTOMO TOMO (Pietro Buffa, Davide Di Gennaro, Luca Pitoni, Giacomo Traldi)Mondadori/Donna ModernaItalyCulture, Art & Design BooksThe Most Beautiful Swiss Books 2016Hubertus DesignFederal Office of Culture, Bern, SwitzerlandSwitzerlandCulture, Art & Design BooksUnfettered ink: The Writings of Chen Chong SweeRootsNational Gallery SingaporeSingaporeCulture, Art & Design CoversThe Art of the EroticPhaidon PressPhaidon PressUnited KingdomIllustrated Books & Graphic NovelsThis Is Me, Full Stop.Here DesignParticular BooksUnited KingdomSpecialist & Limited Edition BooksFor the unforgettable memory woodcutsT-Change DesignChunjie Liu Art StudioChinaSpecialist & Limited Edition BooksHHH—Horses.
