The Unlocks Music Experience has a success rate of selling out and we can confirm that tickets are selling very fast. So, we encourage people to go to Computicket and get their tickets to experience this once in a lifetime show with Chance the Rapper,” says Ramona Kayembe, Castle Lite Marketing Manager. The four curators will bring an extra cold twist on this astronomical stage as they expertly guide concert-goers through the show from each artist to the next in what one can describe as hip-hop symphony. “This year in collaboration with some of Africa’s best, the brand has infused unforgettable multimedia technology with thrilling live stage experiences to craft a concert experience like never done before,” says Kgothatso Kutu, executive producer from Glen 21 Productions. “Castle Lite is not just a concert, It’s an experience and we always try to create a production that is innovative and exciting for audience. We will be breaking boundaries so that consumers can have a one of a kind experience at our concert,” concludes Kutu. The Castle Lite Unlocks concert is on 30 April 2018 at the Coca-Cola Dome with tickets available at Computicket. For more details visit www.castlelite.co.za as we await the biggest concert in Africa!
