"Through this partnership, most of our general and business aviation customers will now be able to use JDM Mobile and the Wombat device to wirelessly update essential charts and data, right in the cockpit. This capability also extends to tens of thousands of customers operating legacy avionics that are not designed for wireless navigation data update capabilities."  <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436688-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Rolls-Royce employee wins CAA safety award" width="120" height="120">Rolls-Royce employee wins CAA safety awardRolls-Royce employee Rory Clarkson has received a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) safety award for his work undertaken in the UK to safely reduce the disruption volcanic ash can cause the aviation industry...8 hours agoInitially, Garmin and Avidyne avionics systems will be supported by the JDM Mobile and Bad Elf Wombat integrated technology, representing a majority of Jeppesen's general aviation pilot customer base. In the coming months, additional avionics systems will be supported across general and business aviation, in total reaching more than 80% of JDM customers.Jeppesen data subscribers using supported avionics platforms are now able to use JDM Mobile to download data updates on an iPhone or iPad and then wirelessly connect to the Bad Elf Wombat device to transfer flight information to avionics data cards. This allows pilots to update their avionics with current data before taking to the skies.Said John Cunningham, CEO, Bad Elf: "Additionally with Wombat, pilots can easily collect flight and engine logs for analysis by several partner apps and services."  Jeppesen navigation data (NavData) is developed from a comprehensive aviation database, which is composed of more than one million records. To ensure accuracy, Jeppesen flight information analysts edit and verify approximately 150,000 database transactions generated from worldwide aviation data source documents during every 28-day revision cycle.
