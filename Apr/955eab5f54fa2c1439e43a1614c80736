Making music with military precisionEven more so when the work they’re getting awarded for goes beyond typical ‘sound production’ work to also include aspects of VR and design. They’re certainly racking up the awards to prove their military precision and accuracy.

It’s an exciting time to be alive and the world is embracing different ways of thinking and expression. This has extended itself into the kind of briefs we get and the jobs we work on. This is notable in the fact that in 2017, we won a few awards due to our involvement in VR and design projects. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us who you personally admire in the industry. A mentor we admire is Colin Shapiro. He has done so much for musicians in South Africa and we shall forever be thankful to him for his efforts in making sure that composers are compensated fairly. Another mentor we admire is Rob Schroder.<img src="http://www.bizcommunity.com/c/1802/430044-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Team Robroy: Schroder, Shannon, Stansfield and Loureiro." width="120" height="120">#LoeriesRanking with...
