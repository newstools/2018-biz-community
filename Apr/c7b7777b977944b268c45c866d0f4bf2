It will train students in understanding how they can stay safe online, provide practical tips and guides, whilst creating a number of youth ambassadors to provide peer-to-peer support. It’s really about creating a safe space where young people can talk to each other and share their experiences.“We take the safety and protection of information of all the people that use our platforms very seriously and this programme shows that we work through partnerships, be it with NGOs, social enterprises, with government and also with fellow tech companies,” says Emilar.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438455.jpg" alt="Qhakaza Mthembu, head of strategy at Digify Africa." width="625" height="417">Qhakaza Mthembu, head of strategy at Digify Africa.Mthembu comments: What’s really important for us is to make sure that young people are safe when they go online to access all the opportunities that are available, which is why we’re really excited to be launching this programme today in partnership with Facebook: Ilizwe Lam – my thoughts, my world, my intellect.“We also know that how the youth use social media is different to how us adults use social media, and that is why we believe a programme like this is so important,” says Ghandi. This is why they included the youth in the development phase. Mthembu explains: “With all our programmes, we know that in order to make the training as compelling and effective as possible, we need to work with the target market in order to co-create the campaigns and curriculum, and we’ve done exactly that with this programme.“We’ve spent quite a lot of time with groups of young people, listening to them and really trying to understand what life is like for them online and the challenges that they face, in order to make sure that the curriculum that we are designing speaks directly to their problems.”I interviewed Ghandi to find out more….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why did Facebook decide to launch a youth-focused online safety programme?Africa is important to Facebook, Facebook cares about South Africa (and Africa) and is invested in genuinely supporting communities, like our youth, about being safe online.

That's why we have the Safety Centre and a set of community standards that we enforce. The programme will provide fun and interaction, with the sessions encouraging peer-to-peer discussions, which we see as key, as well as exploring real-life challenges and how to ensure youths are staying safe online. We're also creating youth ambassadors in high schools and youth clubs to help drive the safety message back in their respective schools or clubs. We are always interested to listen and learn from our partners, interested schools and youth groups on how we can better educate people about being safe online. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are your top tips to manage one’s online safety:Be your authentic selfChoose your friends wiselySet strong passwordsKnow your audience Report abusive contentManage your location privacy Securely log in and log out Be aware of scams Regularly review your privacy settings Regularly check your security settings.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How should one go about deciding what to share online? Most of the time, sharing is good. But if we aren’t thoughtful about how we share, we run the risk of hurting ourselves or someone else.
