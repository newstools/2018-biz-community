Uh, yes, I’m totally working.<img src="http://www.bizcommunity.com/c/1804/437898.jpg" alt="This 'Kitten Kollege' YouTube series is the cutest thing you'll watch today" width="625" height="351">The series takes the idea that anyone (and any species) can learn anything on the internet to heart.“Adopting a tiny kitten is a magical experience, it literally takes seconds after introducing the curious little feline to your home that you realise two things: firstly, cats are Laugh Out Loud adorable, and secondly, you’re needing to learn a whole lot more about your little kitty,” the company explains.It’s both for humans, and seemingly kittens, to educate both parties about the dangers and joys of owning a kitten. This includes everything from kitten-proofing your home (good luck with that), how best to care for their health, and running through the various breeds of cat.Oh, and there’s an actual kitten college students who attend the Kitten Kollege, who listen to lecturers and meow in response.It’s completely adorable. And as a marketing ploy, quite smart.The series not only garners and exploits the internet’s general love for felines, but the clips are also bite sized, short enough to share on social media or view on mobile devices on slower networks. And if you can appreciate the puns (Cat in the Rye, Of Mice and Mice, and countless others), you’ll also spend an inordinate amount of time studying them.Nevertheless, if you’re at work and looking for a pick-me-up, about to add a new member to the family, or just enjoy watching kittens do kitten things, binge the series below.
