The bank's president, Akinwumi Adesina - who served previously as Nigeria's minister for agriculture -- has defended the move. "Africa must develop its energy sector with what it has. Endowed with many different energy sources - both renewable and conventional - Africa needs a balanced energy mix. This must include renewable and conventional sources of power,‚Äù he said in a statement last year.South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe obtain the majority of their electricity from coal, and new research at Wits University has shown how emissions can be reduced, and other chemicals captured for sale as a by-product in the making of steel.Australia, Bangladesh, India, China and the Philippines are increasing their use of fossil fuels, while Tanzania is opening its first coal-fired generator near the southern border with Mozambique.President Donald Trump has voiced his concern over the World Bank and IMF ban and pledged to change the policy. The United States is the largest contributor to both organisations and is also on the board of the African Development Bank.
