<img src="http://www.bizcommunity.com/c/1804/437762.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network gets heads turning in Centurion with their new digital billboard" width="603" height="295">The network sees brands being offered a range of strategically positioned, digital sites delivering high-impact, high-recall advertising within geographically targeted environments. Out-of-home provides super-high frequency, with significant exposure to traffic, which is enhanced in this case by the innovative technology where the billboard structure rotates, aligned to traffic flow and density, to maximise visibility and exposure for advertisers. Strategically positioned, the LED billboard is expected to reach an audience of over 100,000 consumers. With a frequency rate of 12, the site will deliver more than 1.1m impacts every month (ROAD, 2016C). An ideal site for advertisers looking to communicate with targeted upper-income consumers from across Gauteng and beyond. With 20 percent of the households in Centurion earning in excess of R600k annually, it is no surprise that the approximately 236,000 residents are spoiled for choice when it comes to retail and leisure options.  Centurion Mall, Mall@Reds, Centurion Lifestyle Centre and a host of upmarket motor vehicle dealers among others are all situated within the area. As a result of its ideal geographical position for business and leisure, it is a regular destination point for many consumers, business people and casual visitors. Centurion’s host of corporate offices, business premises, retail outlets and regular major cricket matches attract a large number of non-residents virtually non-stop. Many of these visitors inevitably pass through the area surrounding the key mall and business destinations at the intersection of the N1 Freeway and Centurion Mall precinct where the new digital billboard is positioned. Says Patrick de Robillard, Outdoor Network’s Head of Sales, Billboards: “The effectiveness of out-of-home is well documented, and now research is available that shows that digital out-of-home delivers even greater impact and recall.  We’re excited about the launch of our 3x6 rotating digital billboard in the Centurion area as it is positioned in the heart of one the most economically active and dynamic areas within Gauteng.” To find out how Outdoor Network’s roadside LED can help your brand deliver flexible, immediate and effective out-of-home campaigns nationally, contact info@on.co.zabRev('brev-d34f1b50-a583-4e74-98df-1b66acf9b64f', '>a/\<az.oc.no@ofni>"az.oc.no;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh a<').
