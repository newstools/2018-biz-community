According to the company at the time: “Mobile-first indexing means Google will use the mobile version of a web page “for indexing and ranking, to better help our – primarily mobile – users find what they’re looking for.” In March 2018, the move to mobile gathered significant steam.The search engine giant has previously explained that it will have one index for search results, not a mobile-first index that’s separate from its main index. In other words, it will start to look to the mobile web pages to index the web, not the desktop version. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/436723-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Google Go now available locally" width="120" height="120">Google Go now available locallyGoogle has announced that its Google Go app, which provides a "lighter, faster way to search", is now available locally...By Ilse van den Berg 12 Apr 2018“This is huge,” says Laws. "Both SMEs and large enterprises need to immediately appoint a mobile-first task team to get their online presence in order or risk being relegated to the bottom of the pile.”Imaginatrix is advising clients to slash their written web content to the bare minimum, for example, so that it’s easy to read on mobile devices like tablets and cellphones. This will mean mobile web surfers are not lost as they shut down and exit content-heavy pages that appear overwhelming.“Google has moved faster than anyone expected to implement its mobile-friendly policies but this means plenty opportunities for SMEs and other nimble firms able to quickly get their mobile-first house in order,” concludes Laws.
