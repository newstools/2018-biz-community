My role involves defining and driving the strategy of Engage Joe Public. This requires a diverse set of skills and is as much a general management role in that I am leading the agency in all respects, but also as a specialist because I am still very much a PR and reputation management consultant. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list?

I’ve had an atypical career in the sense that I’ve held various roles on both the agency and client side. Most professionals fit into either category and find their niche after trying out life on either side. In my case, I enjoy both and I’ve found my diverse experience gives me perspective and insights on understanding how to add value as a consultant. It has given me the ability to understand my clients’ needs in a way that I may not have done had I never held the position across the table. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in PR?
