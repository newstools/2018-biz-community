It differs from traditional analogue broadcasting service in that, digital signals can be transmitted successfully at lower transmitter power. Digital radio is also easy to use or tune in than analogue radio in the form of amplified modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). Data capabilities of digital radio can be used directly or modified for other related broadcasting activities such as internet radio.Improved spectrum efficiency and spectrum management“The licensing of different forms of broadcasting services require a lot of spectrum, which is a scarce resource and Icasa continues to receive enquiries from the public about licensing processes therefore encouraging and assisting [the] council to make decisions to offer more services to provide for competition in the broadcasting sector”, says councillor Dimakatso Qocha. If and when implemented, digital broadcasting services can improve spectrum efficiency and spectrum management; and offer choice for consumers or South African audiences.Interested parties are invited to make written representations on the published Discussion Document on Digital Sound Broadcasting Services within forty-five (45) working days from the publication of the notice in the Government Gazette.A copy of the discussion document is available at Icasa’s head office library, 164 Katherine Street, Sandton; as well as at all regional offices.
