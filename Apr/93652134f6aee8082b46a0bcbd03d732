In doing this together with JP Morgan, we are aiming to assist in developing basic and functional technology programmes and skills that deliver tangible value to early adopters.”He says that Africa Rising 4.0 will benefit from Tshimologong Precinct’s vast, combined network, which will assist founders and early stage technology companies to inject life into their startups.15 startups will be selected for the incubator programme and will receive advice from established entrepreneurs. The curriculum will be custom-designed to suit the various business entities participating in the programme.

In addition, there will be hands-on support from experts dedicated to helping founders and early stage entrepreneurs. Those interested in participating need a valid proof of concept (POC) with a mock-up or video presentation.
