Where do you live, work and play?I live and work in Lonehill, Jozi and take time out at wine and gin tastings, or eating out, or getting away to the beach or bush.2. What’s your claim to fame? In my mind, it’s that Brendan Seery once gave me an honourable mention in a story about Saturday Star’s Top PR people. 3. Describe your career so far. I’ve worked in PR for almost half my life, both in-house and in consultancy environments. And in some instances, I’ve established and run PR departments from the ground up. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Good gin, wine and food, live music, stand-up comedy, and spending quality time with my family.5. What do you love about your industry? In PR, no one day is ever the same or predictable – it’s constantly challenging and requires a good mix of art and science. There are also endless learning opportunities.6. What are a few pain points your industry can improve on? The ever-challenging PRO–journalist love/hate relationship. And the perception that PR can succeed in isolation of dedicated client input.7. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. There really isn’t an average workday, but each day generally includes scanning the latest news and social media trending topics, emails, coffee, networking, phone calls, writing and pitching editorial content, watching a webinar, listening to talk radio and a podcast or two, and developing yet another proposal with customised recommendations to launch, or reposition, or manage a brand.   8. What are the tools of your trade? Professionalism, resilience, a good balance between creative and strategic thinking, and a strong support team.9. Who is getting it right in your industry? It’s a highly competitive and growing sector, and those not getting it right are quickly ‘found out’.I believe there is an agency for every client and any agency who masters the balance between meeting client objectives, working well with media and engaging successfully with client stakeholders, is getting it right.10. What are you working on right now? Cryptocurrencies, manufacturing, programmatic media, and a retail brand… and a number of new business opportunities.11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? During ‘shower hour’ or while flying between cities.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I have agile toes!14. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Plenty of photos and videos of my toddler, reminders and to-do lists, plus apps for me and apps for my daughter, who often thinks my phone is hers. 15.
