The review of the community broadcasting framework will address known and unknown shortcomings in the regulatory and operational environment of the community broadcasting services sector. The envisaged outcomes of the review include, but not limited to, streamlining the community broadcasting related regulations, a review of the community broadcasting licensing framework, as well as operational guidelines for the community broadcasting services sector. Icasa will be conducting workshops in different areas across nine (9) provinces to solicit input on the Draft Regulations. The workshops will kick off from 15 May 2018 to 06 June 2018 and the schedule for the workshops will be published in due course. Full participation in the regulation-making process encouraged“The community broadcasting sector continues to experience challenges relating to, among others, governance, mismanagement or lack of proper management and lack of business ethos. This process is an important intervention on the part of Icasa to ensure the smooth-running of the sector and to bring the necessary changes that will see the sector being regulated in the public and community interest,” says councillor Botlenyana Mokhele.  Mokhele further encouraged full participation in the regulation-making process so that all matters of concern for the sector can be fully addressed. “It would be great to see submissions from the members of the sector and attendance in the upcoming workshops in particular because they will have to comply with the final regulations when they come into effect. This is, therefore, an opportunity for them to raise any issues they feel Icasa must address to make the sector work better and for the communities they are licensed for,” conclude Mokhele. The findings document and the draft regulations are available on the Icasa website.
