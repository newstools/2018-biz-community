The company says what this means for the user is a "lighter, faster way to search". Voice search has been improved to work better on slow connections. “Users come to us to experience the web and access accurate information quickly. Unfortunately, users can’t always decide on the type of device they have or the kind of connection they are on,” says Google Africa Chief Marketing Officer, Mzamo Masito. “Google Go is designed from the ground up to address these issues and provide a seamless experience irrespective of what device or network the user is on.”Google Go is available today in 26 countries in sub-Saharan Africa through the Google Play Store. It will come pre-installed on all Android Oreo (Go edition) devices, and is available for devices running Android v4.3 (Jelly Bean) and above.
