This is in view of the small but growing body of jurisprudence dealing with directors’ liability under the new Companies Act 71 of 2008. As this was his first ever article submitted to De Rebus, Myburgh expressed his excitement at winning this coveted award: "I needed to hold the directors of a company that owed a client of mine money personally liable for the company’s debt. I looked at De Rebus’s website to see if there were any articles on the topic and couldn’t find any. I decided to do the research and write an article on the topic myself. When the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in the Gihwala decision, independently from me, came to the same conclusion as I did in my article, it gave me a lot of increased confidence in my own legal capabilities.”  The Gihwala case saw the SCA uphold the decision by the Western Cape Division of the High Court to declare Fidentia curator Dines Gihwala a "delinquent director". He was ordered to pay back about R6 million to a shareholder of another company he cheated out of money.
