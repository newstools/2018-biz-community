The festival will launch in 2019 with the aim of becoming a destination for curious, creative minds.Uniquely human quality of creativityWith global debates increasingly dominated by the opportunities and risks created by automation and data, the festival will be an opportunity to recognise, celebrate and learn about how the uniquely human quality of creativity can help industries and businesses to innovate and grow in the face of disruption.The new partnership was announced at D&AD Festival 2018, on Wednesday, 25 April at 6:30pm in the Truman Brewery, Shoreditch. Chief executive of Guardian Media Group David Pemsel said:“This partnership combines the expertise of two of the most respected, long-running and trusted organisations in the creative economy. At a time when digital disruption, automation and AI are impacting every industry, it is clear that creativity no longer simply powers the worlds of media, advertising and design - it is an essential component of any business’s long-term strategy. We are thrilled to be working with D&AD, and together we plan to create an unrivalled festival of creativity, for the UK and the world.”Tim Lindsay, CEO of D&AD, said:“This new annual event will be a one-stop shop for anyone interested in creativity, innovation and contemporary culture. The world does not operate in silos. Our aim is to be an umbrella for all creative thinking, a platform for talent, and a place for business leaders, practitioners and the general public to be energised, invigorated and inspired to integrate creative thinking to achieve business success.”Justine Simons OBE, deputy mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said:“There are few places on earth that can rival our city for its culture and creativity, so it makes perfect sense for London to host this new global festival. As one of the most diverse capitals in the world, London is an ideal place to unite different voices and ensure the best ideas to shape our changing world are given a global platform.”Debbie Millman, designer, educator and podcast host: "Design Matters! I have always been an advocate for the broader world of creative culture. This new partnership will not only benefit the design world but the wider creative and business sectors as well. D&AD and The Guardian's collective reach and the respect they garner will allow this to become a highlight of the global cultural calendar and bring people together to showcase and inspire the creative community."
