We wish to highlight the fact that editorial decisions are made in line with a strict policy and with no intervention or influence by the Tiso Blackstar Group board, its CEO or its shareholders.According to the statement, the Group is not in debt rescue and its debt obligations are not under threat, being serviced in line with commitments. The Group’s debt will be reduced further once the sale of its non-core assets is realised… when the timing allows and the price is right, it said.Its core businesses – Hirt & Carter, Media, and Broadcast and Content – are performing well and are well positioned for growth. “The Group’s cash flow is positive and continues to improve as a result of strong cash management and improved trading conditions.”<img src="http://www.bizcommunity.com/c/1804/437576.jpg" alt="Independent Media sets the record straight" width="120" height="120">Independent Media sets the record straightIndependent Media, through Sekunjalo Independent Media (SIM), was included in the plans of Sagarmatha Technologies, to form part of the multi-sided platform (MSP) technology company's ecosystem which was to list on the JSE last week...Issued by Independent Media 11 hours agoIt went on to say, “Tiso Blackstar would normally refer misleading and dishonest reporting to the Press Ombudsman.  However, Independent Media has withdrawn from the Press Council and refuses to subject itself to the rigors of the Press Code to which Tiso Blackstar and other media companies subscribe. Such withdrawal denies any member of the public, including Tiso Blackstar Group, an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the reports through the regulatory system.“Any allegations by Independent Media and its representatives against Tiso Blackstar Group and its representatives not specifically addressed in this statement are equally denied.”<img src="http://www.bizcommunity.com/c/1804/437232-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Pavel Ignatov -" width="120" height="120">Theories on the Sagarmatha JSE listing that never wasNEWSWATCH: The Public Investment Corporation (PIC) has confirmed that it will not be investing in Sagarmatha Technologies...By Jessica Tennant 2 days ago
