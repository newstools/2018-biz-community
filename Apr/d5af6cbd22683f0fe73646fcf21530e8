Hosted in the forest at the majestic Mdumbi Point in rural Transkei, this is an event unique in its setting.I chatted to Richard, last week. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does music mean to you?It means a hell of a lot to me. Music is an opportunity for me to express myself and share my thoughts and feelings about many different things. I love how emotive and expressive music is. It’s the closest thing we have to magic in my opinion.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436376-625x417.jpg" alt="#MusicExchange: Richard Stirton" width="625" height="417">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What drives you: ego or humility? Humility..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any funny moments on stage?In our first show at Cafe Roux, myself and my guitarist had only had a couple of rehearsals and as a result, decided that for the song he knew the least we would just chart the chords so he didn't have to play it by memory. We, unfortunately, didn't have a music stand so we decided to rest the chart on one of the monitors during the performance. As soon as we started playing the song the vibrations through the speaker caused the chart to fall to the ground. My guitarist then lost his place and began butchering the song. I had the pick up the chart and help him try and find his place while still singing. We still laugh about it today. I enjoy making jokes so there are a lot of funny moments during my set. I love having a captive audience..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Which living person do you admire most and why?I never really sit in awe of anyone. I respect people for what they've achieved. Musically, I would say Harry Styles because coming out of a boy band he went against everything that would be expected when he released his solo album. He stayed absolutely true to himself and the kind of artist he wanted to be, even though he had millions of fans that loved him for an entirely different style of music. I think that illustrates the quality and trueness of the man, something that I feel is lacking in today's popular music scene. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your most treasured possession?I'm not a very materialistic person. I tend to treasure people and places more than objects. I love my guitar, but I could survive using a mediocre one..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}It’s your round, what are you drinking?Jägerbombs..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}The song you wished you wrote? Skinny Love and Kiwi. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What makes you stand out?I feel like I am authentic, honest and relatable. I just try and stay true to myself in all situations. Vocally, I’m pretty dynamic if it comes to the music side of things.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436375-625x417.jpg" alt="Image by Canton Parker" width="625" height="417">Image by Canton Parker.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}If you were not a musician what would you do?Probably work on the super yachts, haha..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Pick five words to describe yourself?Honest, funny, kind, driven, open..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Favourite fashion garment?A nice pair of comfy skinny jeans.
