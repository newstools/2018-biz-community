As a result, they’re judged harshly by society in turn, and rarely turn that critical eye on their own internal matters. So it’s refreshing when the media apologise of their own accord.That’s why National Geographic has been making headlines of its own recently. Long the Western world’s only idea of what went on beyond their borders, it admits it did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture.It’s taken the title’s first female editor-in-chief – the tenth editor of National Geographic since its founding in 1888, Susan Goldberg – to bring to light an investigation of its own ‘racist storytelling’, in a special issue released this month that’s focused on the topic of racism.Al Jazeera reports that the title apologised for “portraying the world through a racist lens”, particularly in its coverage of non-Western cultures and people of colour around the world. Known for its iconic photography, National Geographic had long portrayed darker skinned people as uncivilised, and through its imagery, exoticised non-Western cultures for a largely white and Western audience…Al Jazeera says that’s according to John Edwin Mason, a professor and photography historian at the University of Virginia asked by National Geographic to evaluate its coverage of people of colour over the years. Not seeing South AfricaSouth African content made the yellow-framed evaluation cut. When Mason commented on a 1962 National Geographic story about South Africa, he said: National Geographic’s story barely mentions any problems… There are no voices of black South Africans. That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances… servants or workers. It’s bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers, and photographers had to consciously not see.Addressing gender equalityIn her editorial letter, titled: “For decades, our coverage was racist. To rise above our past, we must acknowledge it,” editor-in-chief Goldberg says: “We can’t now cover stories about race without acknowledging our own past in upholding certain stereotypes.” She explains the editorial team expected there would be a fair amount of conversation around this issue, just as there was when they devoted an entire issue to ‘the gender revolution’, certainly leading the pack in that regard.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1803/432981.jpg" alt="Gender-inclusive marketing" width="120" height="120">Gender-inclusive marketingIn the last few years, the world has seen a massive flux and relaxing in attitudes toward gender and its representation in the media.

It’s not being enlightened, it’s just being fair and thorough.”That said, it’s definitely a positive step forward and other publications have begun to relook at their own coverage to learn lessons from their past.
