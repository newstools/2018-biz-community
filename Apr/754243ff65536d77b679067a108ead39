Sanlam has had a longstanding focus on water conservation. Cape Town’s drought crisis gave it the opportunity to rally the nation to fight together against Day Zero. With the insight that the bathroom accounts for 80% of consumption, with showers using 10l p/m, the agency focused on the City’s request for people to shower in two minutes or less.  Tapping into the insight that people love to sing in the shower, they convinced 10 of the country’s biggest artists to recreate two-minute versions of their hits and launched 2-Minute Shower Songs. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/428406-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scenes from the #2minuteshowersongs and #weewiser campaigns." width="120" height="120">Campaigning to #DefeatDayZeroThe phrases 'water crisis', 'drought' and 'day zero' have been taking up headline space consistently for the past few months. While this has set most of the country into a frenzy, Cape Town-based creatives put their (shower) thinking caps on, with ways to better educate the public and hopefully #DefeatDayZero...By Leigh Andrews 8 Feb 2018This fully integrated campaign was perfectly timed around peak tourist month, when millions of visitors put further strain on municipal water supply. In just six weeks, they rallied residents and visitors to reduce their water use. The Mayor of Cape Town praised Sanlam for being one of the first corporates to heed the call to get behind the cause, and their efforts helped to push Day Zero back by 59 days. According to Patricia de Lille, Mayor of Cape Town:This amazing campaign shows that private sector players are using our City messages to drive their own water-awareness campaigns. We can only make it through this drought together and what a fun way to play your part by jamming in the shower for two minutes or less, to some great songs by our top talents.The campaign grabbed local and international headlines, delivered 147-million impressions and drove 3.4-million engagements.

The creative idea comes before communication platforms, before egos and before baked-in marketing plans and budgets. Once the big idea is decided on then the players collaborate their skills – that’s how they win. The idea needs to connect the clearly articulated target markets with the requisite product and/or brand promise and that, agency, is your part. Marketer: you need to know your brand, products and markets better than anyone else in your category.The only thing limiting an idea is budget (clever planners, strategists and creatives find ways arounds this). What suffocates and dilutes an idea is interference and committee (difficult to avoid on the client side).  PR winners put the idea first and then connect the dots expertly with paths of addictive content between the brand and the audiences, especially reaching non-target audiences, growing the brand and its top line.  A solid understanding – Ruth Kolevsohn, chief operating officer, Burson-Marsteller<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437922.jpg" alt="Ruth Kolevsohn, chief operating officer, Burson-Marsteller." width="250" height="301">Ruth Kolevsohn, chief operating officer, Burson-Marsteller.It was encouraging to see the number of integrated campaigns which were entered this year. While it is hard for ‘PR on a shoestring’ campaigns to compete with those that are backed by significant ATL spend, we have seen a solid understanding of the key audiences in some entries as well as how to reach them through targeted communications, rather than the knee-jerk approach through mass media communication.  Good public relations really is based on a solid understanding of who the audiences are and how to reach them most directly, with messages that resonate with them. We also saw really creative and clever ideas to leverage newsjacking opportunities, increasing the clients’ share of voice by leading conversations on key societal issues.What was really heartening were the efforts made to advise clients on how best to spend their money, rather than just taking a brief and delivering on what was asked.  However, more emphasis needs to be put on delivering real value to clients.Too often, communication objectives focus on measuring reach and dissemination, but we need to evolve as an industry to the point where we spend the time to understand the client’s underlying business objectives and set communication targets which are linked to achieving sales, increasing market share or share price, legislative influence or employee attraction and retention.Simbongile Ndlangisa, operations director at MelenialAbout 30% of the entries were A+, with the rest hovering between ordinary and mediocre. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437244-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Simbongile Ndlangisa" width="120" height="120">#Prisms2018: Meet young judge Simbongile NdlangisaIn the run-up to the 21st Prism Awards taking place on Sunday, 22 April, we chatted to this year's cohort of young judges about their fresh approach to the judging process...By Jessica Tennant 18 Apr 2018It was definitely about whether the campaign goals were achieved and how, but especially, the existence of the 'wow' factor. 2018 finalistsHollard Daredevil Run 2017 Agency: Tribeca Public Relations Client: Hollard The 2017 Hollard Daredevil Run (HDDR) was the most successful in the event’s seven-year history. Tribeca aggressively drove awareness of male-specific cancers (testicular, prostate) during the campaign (December 2016 to March 2017) to educate men that early detection saves lives. The 5km run of purple Speedo-clad men was held simultaneously in four cities, with proceeds to Cansa to sustain the Hollard-branded ManVan, a mobile clinic educating rural men about cancers, and administering free Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1703/385213-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Get ready, set, go!" width="120" height="120">Daredevils take male cancer fight to the streets in SpeedosWarwick Bloom, marketing communications manager at Hollard and Lucy Balona, head of marketing and communication at Cansa, run us through what to expect from the 2017 Hollard Daredevil Run...By Leigh Andrews 23 Mar 2017The result: Of the 9,074 tests in 2017, 337 abnormalities were detected, and 319 men went for further testing.

Uk’Shona KwelangaAgency:  Atmosphere and the King James Group Client:  Sanlam Sky Solutions Project: Uk’Shona Kwelanga  Many South Africans don’t have funeral cover, which causes major drama among family members when a loved one passes away, and the costs can be crippling.
