Orange River Cellars is, therefore, undergoing a strategic turnaround with a greater focus on its own branded products that can add greater value to the chain, as well as look at other avenues to complement and grow the revenue stream.”A natural fitFarmers Pride Raisins is one of South Africa’s leading raisin companies in an industry that produces some 60,000 tonnes of raisins per year, 90% of which originate in the Northern Cape due to its proximity to the Orange River and the sunny climate’s ability to ensure grapes suitable for drying to top-quality raisins.“As part of the Northern Cape’s grape industry, raisin production is a natural fit,” says Du Plessis. “Farmers Pride has a state-of-the-art production plant, knowledgeable and experienced staff and a good client base in the export markets, especially Europe, where the brand has gained a reputation for quality and service delivery. For Orange River Cellars this is an asset that complements our wine offering and cements our position as an inclusive player in the Northern Cape economy and grape-farming industry.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436478-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Raisins drying under the Northern Cape sun.

We are sure that the expansion into the specialist raisin era is the first of many steps towards greater profitability and a dynamic future for our grape farmer members, staff and the Northern Cape community.”
