This sculpture lies on the floor, leaning up against the wall, as dejected, pierced and deflated as abandoned soccer balls often are.The work speaks not only to the realities of growing up in a city environment, where soccer is played in the streets, on concrete and tar, but also to the relationship of soccer with South African industry. One example of this relationship is the 2010 FIFA World Cup. To this day, questions are posed regarding the event’s benefit for the country. Soal’s artwork was chosen as the winner by the PPC Imaginarium Awards national judging panel. The panel included globally acclaimed contemporary artist Mary Sibande and Daniel van der Merwe (who heads the PPC Imaginarium Awards), in addition to renowned local artist Stephen Hobbs and UJ Art Gallery curator Annali Dempsey.The national judges were also responsible for choosing the various category winners and runners-up, as follows:JewelleryWinner: Aleks Ashton Runner-up: Daniella Sachs<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436366.jpg" alt="Winner in the Jewellery category, Aleks Ashton" width="625" height="417">Winner in the Jewellery category, Aleks AshtonFashionWinner: Gabrielle FoulisRunner-up: Nangamso DanaSculptureWinner: Chris SoalRunner-up: Franli Meintjes Industrial DesignWinner: Giovanni ZambriRunner-up: Anton van Reenen<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1804/436367.jpg" alt="Winner in the Fashion category, Gabrielle Foulis" width="300" height="448">Winner in the Fashion category, Gabrielle FoulisFilmWinner: Phumulani NtuliEach of the category winners received R50,000 in cash with the runners-up getting R15,000, bringing the total prize money for the competition to half-a-million-rand.
