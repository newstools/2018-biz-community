Integrated marketing communication, when done properly, is capable of creating a holistic consumer experience that effectively engages one’s emotions and senses, and enhances a brand’s value construct,” she said. Unser has more than 19 years’ experience in the advertising and marketing industries and, prior to returning to 1886, headed up the marketing division of Alpha Investment Group (AIG), a local investment firm that has successfully managed high profile business transactions and mergers. Her experience covers a range of industries including telecommunications, FMCG, financial services, motor, food and beverages, education, parastatals and pharmaceuticals. She has, as part of the agency team, won numerous awards and personally has ranked as the top performing client service professional in South Africa on three separate occasions.
