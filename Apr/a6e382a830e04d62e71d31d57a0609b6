This is in addition to the 1,000 candidates already trained, mentored and placed. This large-scale expansion has been enabled through the generous support from South African corporate businesses, in particular R100m from BCX, and also R75m from the National Treasury Jobs Fund. CapaCiTi's success lies in the agility of the programme curricula in response to the South African business sector's skills needs; and importantly, the high emphasis on soft skills training and real-workplace experience, alongside the core technical training. Strong relationships with corporate partners are a key focus for CiTi, not only ensuring partners’ talent pipeline is well understood and met, but to successfully secure great career opportunities for graduates.Through CapaCiTi programmes, unemployed previously disadvantaged young individuals (40% female) are equipped with a relevant and work-ready skill set which they go on to apply in their internship and permanent placement in one of CapaCiTi's partners. CapaCiTi has achieved a 97% placement rate in 130 South African companies to date, allowing them to significantly grow, diversify and retain their young tech talent. Ian Merrington, CEO of CiTi says, “South Africa faces an enormous unemployment problem whilst at the same time the economy is being constrained from growing at its full potential due to a shortage of appropriate skills. This is further exacerbated by a rapid change to our old economic model as the new digital economy becomes pervasive. Disruptive technology is damaging social cohesion throughout the world, but we see this as a massive opportunity for South Africa to unlock all the latent talent which we have by providing access to relevant, responsive skills training and education.”The National Treasury Jobs Fund investment presents South African companies with the opportunity to leverage 40% more value for their training expenditure, and access to a talent pipeline that directly meets their needs. Loan and work-back agreements built into an innovative financial model guarantee the sustainability and scalability of the project, and candidate accountability. CiTi views these as the cornerstones of real impact. “Through this partnership, the Jobs Fund is catalysing the growth of a high-quality, demand driven ICT ecosystem where employers,  training organisations and youth  have vested interest in growing effectively. This shared interest will overcome the ongoing skills constraints faced by industry and result in sustainable long-term employment for the unemployed youth. CiTi has certainly demonstrated its ability to produce the desired results,” says Najwah Allie-Edries, head of the Jobs Fund.Apply for a CapaCiTi programmeCapaCiTi is searching for talented young individuals to join its July programmes in Johannesburg and Cape Town.
