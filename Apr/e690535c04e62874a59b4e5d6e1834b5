The agency took home two silver and three bronze awards. Ogilvy South Africa’s Influence and Public Relations National Managing Director, Joanna Oosthuizen, said the awards were the result of “an integrated and holistic approach to public relations with a dynamic newsroom, content and data and analytics at the heart of everything that we do."   Ogilvy’s winning campaigns were:   Best Campaign with Social Media as Support: The KFC SoundBite (Silver) real-time music platform was promoted using a carefully constructed influencer strategy which created a social media movement for local music with 254 million impressions and over 2 million video views.  Social Media as the Primary Method of Communication: KFC Black Fried Day (Silver) - using social listening, BlackFriday shoppers were rewarded with a KFC voucher. Over one day, more than 40 videos, GIFs and static responses for Twitter fans were personalised and the campaign generated 10 million potential impressions and 288,000 engagements.   Media Relations: Woolworths’ Myndplay (Bronze) media launch achieved remarkable impact and media coverage by being the first such event in Africa to use Myndplay, a fascinating cutting-edge technology that reads the mind and generates a drawing reflecting the mind’s activity.  Business to Business: Audi’s Corporate Communications (Bronze) campaign established trust and an identity for Audi Masterbrand – a brand that traditionally only engaged in motoring media. The PR efforts resulted in R30m in coverage and 42 billion impressions generated. Consumer PR for an Existing Product: The Gumtree Pre-Owned Car Awards (Bronze) were launched in a way that generated exceptional media coverage worth over R2m in AVE and social media reach of over 7 million. Gumtree saw a 75% growth year-on-year in organic vehicle searches on the site during the campaign period.
