They believed in me and helped create opportunities for me to learn and grow. That being said, people will only support you if they believe you are capable and so my advice to aspiring women is deliver the results, build your network and invest in your relationships. Listen and assess your environment, be humble when humility is called for but fight when you need to.People will walk all over you if they believe they can, so stay strong and don’t compromise who you are.Learn as much as you can (knowledge is indeed power) and stay abreast of industry trends so you’re always ahead of the curve.
