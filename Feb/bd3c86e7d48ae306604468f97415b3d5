It is drop tested to 1.8 metres with a factory fitted screen protector, and the manufacturer claims it can survive underwater, including salt water, complying to IP68 rating and can cope with extreme temperatures, thermal shock, humidity and vibration exposure.  According to the manufacturer, the 5-inch full HD screen is optimised for sunlight legibility, while the touchscreen can be controlled with wet fingers or while wearing gloves. Improved connectivity options are provided by a dual-SIM feature, giving users the ability to connect to two networks.A report on Engadget states: "Bullitt has created a Bike Pack too, which comes with a stem and handlebar mount, and a battery pack that adds 4370mAh to the main unit. Each pack can also be set to automatically launch a navigation app. These include ViewRanger, a premium application with detailed Ordnance Survey maps for hikers and cyclists."
