But its total loss halved to R504m from R1.1bn. In its 2016 interim results, Aveng reduced its after-tax loss by a further R709m.The group's chairman, Eric Diack, who has been acting CEO following Kobus Verster's return to ArcelorMittal SA, said in his outlook: "Domestically, the outlook for the infrastructure market remains subdued with limited visibility on large-scale projects. "However, recent changes in the political environment have led to an improved sentiment in SA. There are opportunities to increase exports for the manufacturing operations."Source: BDpro
