<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429523.jpg" alt="The AMASA Workshop is back - now open for bookings!" width="312" height="141">Presented in an all-new format, this year’s workshop will feature 40 top industry experts, who will be sharing their knowledge in speed-networking, panel-style discussions rather than by making presentations in a classroom-like setting. This will enable delegates to participate more fully in each session and will also allow for real-life, first-hand experience and coaching. The jam-packed workshop, which will offer a snapshot view of the media landscape, will start on 22 March and will kick off with two days of intensive learning on such topics as strategy development, media planning and campaign evaluation. On the third day, delegates will be split into groups and a selected client will present a live brief to each group. They will then be required to develop and present a full-circle strategy in response to the brief to the client. Judging and feedback will take place on the final day, and this will be followed by a celebratory graduation dinner and party. The AMASA Workshop has become an annual rite of passage in the media and advertising industry - and this year’s event won’t disappoint! It will allow both new and experienced media practitioners to fully understand the briefing process from an agency point of view, as well as to learn about how to collaborate with suppliers in order to improve outcomes, networking and relationships. If you operate in the media and advertising industry, whether as an agency, media owner or marketer, this workshop is here to inspire you. It will also provide a strong set of media and leadership skills designed to enable you to keep up to speed with the ever-changing media landscape.
