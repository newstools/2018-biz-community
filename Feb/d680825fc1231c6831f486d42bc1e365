It counts many well-known South African businesses amongst its clients.“We are really excited and looking forward to a highly beneficial partnership with Pula Capital and LRMG. We believe that together we can grow our business exponentially and open doors to untapped opportunities both in South Africa and further into the Africa continent,” said Gary Segal, CEO of Game On. “What excited us most about a Pula/LRMG tie-up was the ability to leverage off their best practices and impressive client base. “We also expect that now being black owned, this will open up a number of opportunities previously closed to us. We liked the cultural fit and the strong support for us to continue to manage our own destiny as an entrepreneurial company, while being able to leverage off the back of a larger group – without being stifled in any way,” Gary added. LRMG recognises that customer loyalty is harder to maintain than ever before and – despite living in a digital era – human interaction continues to play an integral part of the customer journey. The acquisition of Game On expands LRMG’s performance capabilities, enabling its clients to develop new approaches to delivering outstanding in-person customer service experiences in today’s increasingly competitive world. “From the outset, LRMG’s game plan has been to grow both organically and through acquisition. We’re always on the lookout for companies that are innovating in the performance space. We’re passionate about developing integrated, adaptable high-performance solutions that deliver real results and a great return on investment for our clients. We are certain that Game On will be a valuable player in our group and look forward to working together,” said Ricky Robinson, CEO of LRMG. Pula seeks to invest in companies to which it can really add value, and ones that are synergistic with LRMG. Some industries of interest include e-learning, management consulting, IT, HR, professional training and marketing & advertising. Deals are structured in a highly flexible manner and strong performance criteria are included to ensure committed growth is achieved through the collaboration.
