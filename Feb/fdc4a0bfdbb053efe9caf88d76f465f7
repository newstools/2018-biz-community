The Glide is now the top-of-the-range derivative.It's cute, it's quirky, it's compactKitted out with more than the average entry-level hatchback, the Grand i10 Glide is cute and quirky, that's for sure. But it's also compact while not being too tight on space - perfect for a first-time student car, a second family vehicle, or for those who want to scale down to something more easily maintainable later in life.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429445-625x325.jpg?1" alt="Tried and tested: Hyundai Grand i10 1.25 Glide Manual" width="625" height="325">The spaciousness inside is noteworthy, considering its petite outside appearance. Apart from the smaller dashboard, I could have sworn I was inside my i20. Legroom in the back also looks adequate. Concerning boot space, it boasts a capacity of 256 litres and up to 1,202 litres become available when the rear seats are folded down.The Glide derivative features electrically heated side mirrors that can also fold in at the touch of a button, and an "infotainment" centre with a large full-colour touch-screen. It also features steering wheel remote controls (hallelujah!), including buttons for the Bluetooth connectivity for cell-phones and an integrated microphone. The pairing of my phone was super easy - probably the easiest I've experienced in a long time.Customers will need to buy an SD memory card for R2,500 to activate the navigation system on the infotainment system.How about engine and safety stuff?The flagship 1.25 Grand i10 Glide (five-speed manual) features a 1.25-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine. It delivers 64kW at 6,000r/min, with a maximum torque delivery of 120Nm at 4,000r/min.The car includes dual airbags - one for the front passenger and the other for the driver - and ABS.What else?The Glide also features alloy wheels, park distance control sensors in the rear bumper, and LED daytime running lights. Interior styling and trim includes black leather and red cloth as well as red inserts on the instrument and door panels, and the centre console.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429446-625x325.jpg?1" alt="Tried and tested: Hyundai Grand i10 1.25 Glide Manual" width="625" height="325">Other derivatives in the lineup include the 1.0 Grand i10 Motion (five-speed manual); 1.0 Grand i10 Motion (four-speed auto); and the 1.0 Grand i10 Fluid, also with the five-speed automatic gearbox.Apart from the 1.25 Glide MT, the other derivatives with the more powerful engine are the flagship 1.25 Grand i10 Fluid (five-speed manual) and 1.25 Grand i10 Fluid (four-speed auto).Competitors in this segment include the Kia Picanto, Ford Figo, Renault Kwid, Honda Brio, Toyota Aygo, and Polo Vivo.How many bucks?The Glide costs R202,900 with a two-year/30,000km service plan, Hyundai's five year/150,000km manufacturers warranty, additional two years/50,000 km powertrain warranty, and five-year/150,000km roadside assistance.ConclusionAccording to Hyundai, 8,342 units of the i10 were sold in 2017 and it is hoping to increase that sales figure substantially this year. I'd say the Grand i10 is definitely a good buy and pretty well-specced for the price.
