Unlocking e-commerce potentialSouth African online sales recently surpassed the 1% mark of total retail sales. Whilst a milestone achievement, developed economies are proportionally further ahead, and South Africa and other African countries require exponential growth to catch up. “The 1% problem is as much an intriguing opportunity as it is a daunting task, the potential for growth and rapid acceleration is real. Understanding where the acceleration opportunities lie not only from an online retail perspective, but in the payments, funding and fulfilment space is what MoneyAfrica 2018 is all about,” says Terry Southam, managing director of conference and exhibition company Kinetic. <img src="/c/1802/430715-625x325.jpg?1" alt="DHL E-commerce MoneyAfrica conference set for Cape Town in March" width="625" height="325">Key themesAccording to the event organisers, guests will be afforded networking opportunities to connect and collaborate with bright minds in the online marketplace.
