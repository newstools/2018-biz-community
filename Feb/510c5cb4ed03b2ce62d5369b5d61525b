"The effect of the predation is also likely to deter future competition on this route from other airlines," deputy commissioner Hardin Ratshisusu said in a statement.Airlink CEO Rodger Foster denied the allegations and said the carrier welcomed the opportunity to put its case before the tribunal so that the matter could be put to rest.The service between Mthatha and Johannesburg remained operational, he said.The commission is seeking a penalty of up to 10% of Airlink's annual turnover.Source: Business Day
