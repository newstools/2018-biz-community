<img src="/c/1802/429813.jpg" alt="New construction-focused academy launches" width="625" height="417">© industryview – 123RF.comThe academy is a subsidiary of leading investment firm, Afribiz Invest, and the institution has programmes designed specifically to ensure employability in either one of Afribiz Invest’s companies or to equip learners with the necessary skills for the job market.“Too many young South Africans study in isolation from the working world,” says Tameez Chothia, Afribiz Academy marketing manager. “They then really struggle to find a way to get a job – even after all the studying. Afribiz Academy helps students study with a view to the immediate, practical application of their skills. Often, our students study and work at the same time, which is an ideal way to build a track record and employability credentials in a sector that features a lot of opportunities.”Afribiz Academy is in the famous Corner House building on Commissioner Street, Johannesburg. The organisation offers an extensive range of short courses as well as longer, and more conventional degrees such as Civil and Mechanical Engineering.   “We offer training in electrical, plumbing, building, and other construction related sectors in South Africa, with faculties in civil engineering, mechanical engineering and health and safety,” says Chothia. “We are new to the market but already the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from employers, who need to access the right kind of talent, and from students, because the academy allows them to acquire the right skills to enter the built environment - without taking the risk of studying for years and emerging without work prospects.” Afribiz Academy’s admission requirements vary, and offer meaningful, practical opportunities for high school graduates and those who possess a Grade 9 certificate alike. “An NQF Level 2 qualification, for example, can be an important ticket into the sector,” says Chothia. “To achieve this, you don’t need a university pass, you need a Grade 9 certificate. Once you get your foot in the door with a Level 2 qualification, you can build up to higher NQF levels through more short courses. Crucially, you can do this over time, while working.”Afribiz Academy is holding an open day on 26 February 2018. These offer excellent opportunities for students and families to discover more about tertiary education in the built environment.  “The open days are very informative,” says Chothia. “They help families understand the specific tertiary education context for each learner. Open day visitors can discuss specific issues with teachers from the academy. This allows them to get a real sense of what the sector is all about, and how the student may fit into it. We encourage aspirant learners to attend, and to bring relevant family members with them.”Potential applicants can visit the Afribiz Academy website at www.afribizacademy.com to download an application form.
