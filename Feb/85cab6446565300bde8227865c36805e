Where do you live, work and play?I relocated from Johannesburg to Cape Town in 2001 and live in the Blouberg area of the most beautiful city in the world. I am privileged to call it my playground for both work and fun!2. What is your claim to fame? I’ve been a TV presenter for Expresso Morning Show on SABC3 for the past seven years, it’s a two-and-a-half-hour live lifestyle show. I’m also a radio host on Smile 90.4FM, with my show between 12 and 3pm, with features ‘Guess who’s coming for lunch’ and ‘Shape up’.3. Describe your career so far. It has been a journey of challenges, growth, in both skill and personality, realisations and, most of all, a ton of fun. I am truly blessed to do what is in line with my personality.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. The outdoors, travel, people and food. Then I have to mention my beautiful wife Adrienn and our two gorgeous boys.5. What do you love about your industry? The fact that every day brings something different, the fact that I get to interact with a myriad of people and on occasion get to travel, but mostly that I feel at home in my unique way.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Yes there is some method to the madness. Expresso is a fixed timeslot between 6:30 and 9am every morning and my radio show at Smile 90.4FM airs between noon and 3pm. In between is the challenge of having to find the time to prep for the shows and compile content, filming inserts on locations, doing voice-over work, attending events and getting in some quality family time. Oh yes, then there’s also my fitness side where I try to get in a good workout at least five days a week. The juggle is real!7. What are the tools of your trade? It all comes down to my personality that enables me to resonate with all kinds of people on a human level. I love connecting with people and that has helped me immensely in my line of work. The modeling and fitness side definitely play a role, too!8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Everyone is getting it right in his or her own way; if you can survive and thrive in this industry, you are doing something right.9. List a few main points the industry can improve on. The industry is the Industry, and it works the way it is, but just like most things, a bigger budget for local productions would be nice!10. What are you working on right now? Right now, I am focused on building my radio side, but my focus is still largely TV, as that has been such a big part of my life. Hopefully some exciting developments this year!11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. Haha! On fleek and yaaaaaas… it sounds just strange when I say it though!12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? When I’m able to step away and switch off, mostly in nature somewhere, camping.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? Besides, lighting Blue Zambuca in my mouth? Haha, I keep the tricks for those who feel they need to impress.14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? I am smack-bang in the middle, I love my tech, gadgets, but give me braai tongs for a week, and I will be just fine.15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Many selfies, pics of my kids and our adventures, and a lot of work docs!16.
