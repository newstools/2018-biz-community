He said startups had a decision to make about whether they needed to raise funding at all.“Not all companies need VC money. There are plenty of good companies that will build without raising. It is the founder’s choice,” he said.This was a view shared by Wale Ayeni, who leads the IFC’s VC operations in Africa.<img src="/c/1802/430122-120x120.jpg?2" alt="AfriLabs Annual Gathering moves to Tanzania" width="120" height="120">AfriLabs Annual Gathering moves to TanzaniaPan-African network of tech hubs AfriLabs has announced its Annual Gathering will take place in October, with the event moving to Tanzania for the first time...By Gabriella Mulligan 23 hours ago“The best kind of money you can ever raise is the money you get from customers. That is product validation. I know people who have been able to do big businesses without investment,” he said.Should a startup decide they do require investment, however, they are starting from a position of weakness with funders.“It is a funder’s market, and I don’t see that changing for a couple of years. That’s unfortunate, but it is what it is,” Sum said, with Ben Peterson, senior partner at AHL Venture Partners, adding that early-stage companies in Africa were “running through a gauntlet”.Though Ayeni said there was no one set way of raising funding – “There’s no easy advice, there’s no silver bullet, it’s just hustle” – panellists did offer some advice when it came to securing investment.Sum said it was important to focus on solving a problem and be passionate about the business.“Try to solve problems you know well and care about. These are very long journeys. There is no quick win in this industry. You must be doing something you care about,” he said.<img src="/c/1802/429672-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Tumi Menyatswe.

You have to figure out how to get to that market. Tech is not going to change that. Tech is an enabler, but you must understand the power of the mass market,” he said.When it comes to actually approaching investors and securing funding, Sum said startups needed to approach it in stages and be aware it usually takes a long time.“It is a much longer process than you expect. There are lots of logistics behind it. So I would advise starting to prepare well in advance,” he said.Peterson said startups would be well served by sitting down with someone in the know and getting walked through the entire process of fundraising before they set off on the journey.<img src="/c/1802/429567-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Why 2018 could be brighter for SA startups" width="120" height="120">Why 2018 could be brighter for SA startupsThe South African economy is showing early signs of turning the corner after a couple of years of disappointing growth and high volatility, meaning 2018 holds promise of increased opportunities for local SMEs...By Tom Jackson 16 Feb 2018“And I think as you learn more you will see where there are alignments with investors, and the process will become a lot more efficient. You need to find the investors that are focused on your type of business and your type of risk,” he said.In spite of all the challenges, Peterson believes startups are operating in a market with a myriad of opportunities and one in which investors will increasingly see the value.“A lot of these markets are going to see incredible, crazy growth. It is going to be a crazy ride. We have to keep in mind that we are just at the beginning, and we are now starting the real acceleration phase,” he said.
