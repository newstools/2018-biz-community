By iconising political figures (mostly Donald Trump), Rodriguez creates a powerful vernacular, which has inspired all manner of public participation.Rodriguez’s unique vision of seeing Trump’s signature orange and yellow image in everything from flaming comets, to no dog poop signage, babies, bombs, emojis, the Statue of Liberty, wrecking balls and goop, has succeeded in capturing the public zeitgeist, speaking for the collective, as people across America freely crowd share his images at marches and rallies to protest the presidential stance on immigration, racism, inappropriate outbursts (sh!thole, fake etc), warmongering and other issues. <img src="/c/1802/430436.jpg" alt="Exhibition of Trump posters by  on display at Design Indaba 2016 by ." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1802/430437.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="942" data-lheight="600" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Exhibition of Trump posters by Edel Rodriguez on display at Design Indaba 2016 by Terry Levin.<img src="/c/1802/430439.jpg" alt="Exhibition of Trump posters by  on display at Design Indaba 2016 by ." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1802/430440.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="900" data-lheight="542" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Exhibition of Trump posters by Edel Rodriguez on display at Design Indaba 2016 by Terry Levin.<img src="/c/1802/430441.jpg" alt="Exhibition of Trump posters by  on display at Design Indaba 2016 by ." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1802/430442.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="704" data-lheight="400" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Exhibition of Trump posters by Edel Rodriguez on display at Design Indaba 2016 by Terry Levin.<img src="/c/1802/430443.jpg" alt="Exhibition of Trump posters by  on display at Design Indaba 2016 by ." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1802/430444.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="858" data-lheight="600" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Exhibition of Trump posters by Edel Rodriguez on display at Design Indaba 2016 by Terry Levin.<img src="/c/1802/430447.jpg" alt="Exhibition of Trump posters by  on display at Design Indaba 2016 by ." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1802/430448.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="678" data-lheight="600" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Exhibition of Trump posters by Edel Rodriguez on display at Design Indaba 2016 by Terry Levin.<img src="/c/1802/430445.jpg" alt="Exhibition of Trump posters by  on display at Design Indaba 2016 by ." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1802/430446.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="810" data-lheight="600" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Exhibition of Trump posters by Edel Rodriguez on display at Design Indaba 2016 by Terry Levin.Rodriguez has also become his own story, receiving coverage on major news channels as well as regular commissions for iconic covers of Time and Der Spiegel magazines. The vital virality is achieved by live street painting, sets of stencil posters handed out on the street and cute Impeach the Peach stickers, distributed via the little-used medium of, well, peaches! A recent, curated exhibition of 100’s of Rodriguez’s Trump images was held at Wieden Kennedy, Oregon under the title of Agent Orange will soon be turned into a collectable book.

In her case the desire to create a sense of home and belonging for the displaced, dispossessed or indisposed. Myerscough’s signature, riotous colour and the use of the simplest geometric shapes and materials, act as a leveller embracing and inviting all walks of society to see and to be happy.She cites Andy Warhol, the Memphis style and an exhibition entitled Hockney Paints the Stage as her key artistic influences and her output could be said to be a fusion of these, with undertones hinting at her family heritage in the circus and a self-confessed obsession with carnivals. <img src="/c/1711/416888-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Morag Myerscough © ." width="120" height="120">First speaker for Design Indaba Festival 2018 announcedBritish designer, Morag Myerscough is the first speaker announced for the Design Indaba Festival 2018...1 Nov 2017Installations with this express intention – of creating a sense of belonging – have been commissioned in many places around the world, from Melbourne to Mexico.As seen in the work of Rodriguez earlier, public participation validates and adds credibility to projects. For example, the go-ahead on the proposal to add colour to wards in the Sheffield Children’s Hospital to make them look more like bedrooms, was achieved by showing the colourful models to the children themselves, who gave it the thumbs up. Projects for a pavilion in Austria and a new art block for the South London Gallery among others are approached with the same generosity of participation. For example, workshops held with the teenagers, families or child stakeholders actively invite naming ideas or the creation of artworks using bright, geometric sticker patterns which will be incorporated into the final installations, have the immediate effect of creating the desired sense of ownership and accomplishment by the makers.Tracking these kinds of purist case studies demonstrates how the basic building blocks of design – form, colour and pattern – can be used to positively affect outcomes on many levels, in education, healthcare, public and private spaces – you just have to ask.For more:www.designindaba.com
