If I had to round up the weekend with one central theme it would be ‘statement’. Most of the designers sported unique aesthetics with powerful, meaningful thought behind their design. Slogans with an inclination towards activism – anti-abuse and other powerful declarations were used to ingrain awareness of social issues, e.g. ‘Love is Safe’ at Magents;  ‘We are because they were’ at Unknown - and the use of face paint, reminded me of ancient tribal markings in Africa.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429378.jpg?1" alt="Magents" width="387" height="580">Magents<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429379.jpg" alt="Magents" width="387" height="580">Magents<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/401338-120x120.png?2" alt="Seven top trends from SA Menswear Fashion Week" width="120" height="120">Seven top trends from SA Menswear Fashion WeekThe SA Menswear Spring Summer collection recently took place at the Palms in Woodstock from Thursday, 6 July to Saturday, 8 July...By Meagan Duckitt 13 Jul 2017The top trends identified were:AsymmetryWraps and overlapped fronts on coats and jackets as well as bottoms were key, and finished off looks with a bit of an Oriental touch, as showcased by Duke, House of St Luke, Zeitgeist, and Augustine.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429381.jpg" alt="House of St Luke" width="387" height="580">House of St Luke<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429382.jpg" alt="Neo Serati" width="387" height="580">Neo SeratiAthleisureAs most silhouettes were more relaxed this year, tracksuits were a huge trend, and track pants were juxtaposed with tailored jackets, denim jackets and coats, as shown by Augustine, Duke, and Kidd Hunta.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429383.jpg" alt="Augustine" width="386" height="580">Augustine<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429384.jpg" alt="Duke" width="387" height="580">DukeChecksThis classic trend was celebrated in variations of tartans, checkerboard, Argyle, and plaids, as showcased by Chulaap, Issa Leo and Unknown Union.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429385.jpg" alt="Chulaap" width="387" height="580">Chulaap<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429386.jpg" alt="Unknown Union" width="387" height="580">Unknown UnionFaceoffStatement faces, celebrating designer’s individuality by means of painted faces, accompanied the designs of Magents, Maxivive, Rosey & Vittori, and Tokyo James.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429387.jpg" alt="Rosey &amp; Vittori" width="387" height="580">Rosey & Vittori<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429388.jpg" alt="Tokyo James" width="387" height="580">Tokyo JamesGrampy’s bestAugustine, Solsol, Chulaap and Terrence Bray, all paid homage to their grampy in retro-inspired cardigans, pullovers, and jumpers, rocking 70s grandpa prints and colours.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429389.jpg" alt="Chulaap" width="387" height="580">Chulaap<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429390.jpg" alt="Terrence Bray" width="387" height="580">Terrence BrayLayeredEvery year this trend seems to appear in different styles and interesting details.
