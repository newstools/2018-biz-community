"Ethiopian authorities should immediately release Eskinder Nega without condition."At 11am local time, a prison official asked Eskinder to sign a form which falsely stated that he was a member of Ginbot 7, an organisation that the government deems a terrorist group, Eskinder's wife, Serkalem Fasil, told CPJ.Eskinder refused and asked to see a more senior official. That request was not granted, and the journalist was returned to his cell, his wife said.Eskinder is serving an 18-year sentence on vague terrorism charges, according to CPJ research. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention condemned his 2012 trial and conviction and said it was connected to his "peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression". The group found his arrest without warrant and prosecution was flawed, and the trial fell short of international standards of fairness.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426797-120x120.jpg" alt="Why release of two journalists in Ethiopia does not signal end to press crackdown" width="120" height="120">Why release of two journalists in Ethiopia does not signal end to press crackdownEthiopia's use of imprisonment, harassment, and surveillance means that the country continues to be a hostile environment for journalists...By Muthoki Mumo and Jonathan Rozen 26 Jan 2018
