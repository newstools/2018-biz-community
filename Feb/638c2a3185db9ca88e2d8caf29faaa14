(video)8 Sep 2017BMW follows a maxim that "production follows the market", making China ripe for investment in local manufacturing.Reaching 560,000 units in 2017, Chinese sales of BMW-brand cars - produced locally under a joint venture with carmaker Brilliance - outweighed shipments in other major markets the United States and Germany combined."A similar growth strategy could accelerate development of the Mini brand significantly," BMW said.It added that it would continue talks with Great Wall "without questioning BMW Group's commitment in the UK," where production of electric Minis is slated to begin at an Oxford plant next year.The firm added that it would "further expand" its joint venture with Brilliance, but did not offer further details.Source: AFP
