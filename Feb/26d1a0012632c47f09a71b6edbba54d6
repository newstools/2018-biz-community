The UAE is a major destination hub for Western Cape halal products seeking to enter into the Middle East. The region has a rapidly growing population which is opening up tremendous opportunities for Western Cape food and agriculture producers and exporters. Increasing market access for our products will help us achieve the goals of Project Khulisa which are to grow jobs and investment in the agricultural and agro-processing sectors.”Harris added that investment into agribusiness, and boosting agricultural exports would be hugely beneficial to the agricultural sector during the drought. “By attracting investors into agribusiness, and boosting exports of agricultural goods, we will be able to better support this critical sector during these challenging times. Agriculture is a key component of the Western Cape economy, and we are working hard, in line with our trade and investment mandate, to assist this sector.”
