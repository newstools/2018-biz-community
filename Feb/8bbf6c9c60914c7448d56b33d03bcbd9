See It Be It was launched in 2014 to shine a light on the issue of gender imbalance at senior levels and galvanise the industry into action. The initiative serves as an acceleration programme aimed at identifying future female leaders in creative functions in the branded communications industry and tackling the gender disparity across the creative sector. Leadership themeIn recent years, Spotify has engaged in a series of global initiatives internally and with partners to drive inclusivity and diversity across all of their business functions. Spotify’s Danielle Lee, VP, global head of partner solutions and Jackie Jantos, VP, brand and creative at Spotify, will be involved with See It Be It onsite at the Festival and throughout the year-long programme of events.“The creative community is only as effective as the talent it employs. As the world becomes rapidly more diverse and multifaceted, it is imperative that creative talent reflects the world we live in,” says Lee, VP, global head of partner solutions at Spotify. “We look forward to partnering with See It Be It to enable women of all backgrounds to achieve their maximum potential in creative marketing." Building on last year’s theme of ‘Confidence’, the theme for 2018, set by this year’s ambassador Chloe Gottlieb is ‘Leadership’. Participants will develop skills to lead from the inside-out and will realise a direct impact on confidence and ambition over time.
