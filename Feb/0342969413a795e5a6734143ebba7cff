Agri SA wishes to alert farmers that the application of chemicals must be carried out in consultation with chemical representatives.Although this Fall armyworm attacks mostly maize plants, it may occasionally attack cotton, wheat, sorghum, soya beans, potatoes and groundnuts. It is therefore also important to scout these crops for damage and the presence of the invasive species.Dan Kriek, president of Agri SA, thanked Grain SA and other roleplayers who monitor the situation on behalf of the grain industry.
