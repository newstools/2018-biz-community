Fans will also need to pre-register in order to be able to purchase tickets and accommodation. Tickets will officially go on sale on Monday, 26 March 2018 at 9am on www.RockingtheDaisies.com.Camping passes will be sold separately and campers who snatch up tickets early will be able to secure the best spots, closest to the main gate and the festival arena. This will create cleaner camping grounds, smooth-running bathroom lines and improve security in each camping space. For those who thrive off of the energy in the main campsite and aren’t ones for glamping, then priority camping is for you. It’s a safe, controlled environment with better facilities (WCs included). This year’s RTD will also introduced a Ladies Camp. The new women-only campsite will be a place for women to retreat, relax, camp and make friends with other women, and participate in women-centred experiences exclusive to Daisies.   Musicians, film-makers, artists, graphic designers, performers, and entertainers are invited to submit their work for consideration on the RTD website on 26 March 2018. Businesses are also invited to apply to trade at #RTD2018 and may head over to www.RockingtheDaisies.com from 26 March 2018.Pre-register for tickets here
