Bored by music concerts visuallyDevlin has worked on projects for the likes of La Scala Milan, Leipzig Opera, Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She also did work on Ernst Bloch's Macbeth and Cullberg Ballet. She told Vice Noisey in an interview that when she began, she was bored by a lot of theatres.I was into music. I was bored by music concerts visually, too. I was visually unexcited and not fascinated by theatre because I found it very old-fashioned. Opera I found exciting because opera designers were beginning to do something more abstract. Then, in the early 90s, I started seeing people begin to use projection, and begin to envelop film and theatre together.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426951-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Neri Oxman © Noah Kalina." width="120" height="120">Neri Oxman announced as speaker at Design Indaba 2018Architect, designer and inventor, Neri Oxman, has been announced as one of the speakers at this year's Design Indaba Conference 2018...By Juanita Pienaar 29 Jan 2018Devlin shot to fame in 2005 when hip-hop artist, Kanye West commissioned her to work on a project for his Touch the Sky World Arena Tour.

His relationship with his design team is also evolving. He really is the director of every decision and one has to say that.”In search of connection and meaningIn addition, Devlin also did work for the Pet Shop Boys, Jay Z, Adele, Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. Talking about working with these famous performing artists, Devlin told The Independent that, “They’re standing in front of 80,000 people – you generally don’t do that as a barefoot creature, you have your character on… Generally, humans operate in search of connection and meaning.” <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/427382-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Johannes Torpe announced as speaker at Design Indaba 2018" width="120" height="120">Johannes Torpe announced as speaker at Design Indaba 2018Danish designer and CEO and creative director of the design company, Johannes Torpe Studios has been announced as one of the speakers at this year's Design Indaba Conference 2018...By Juanita Pienaar 5 Feb 2018Devlin was also part of the design team on the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and MTV Europe Music Awards (2011 and 2010).
