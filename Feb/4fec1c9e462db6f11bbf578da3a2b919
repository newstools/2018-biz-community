Vadi was on Wednesday speaking during the launch of the project. Other works include resurfacing the section leading to the N4 freeway, application of road markings and the installation of traffic signals.Vadi said that upon completion the road will serve as an important link between Mamelodi and the N4 freeway and act as an alternative to Moloto Road. It will also improve road safety in the township.He emphasised that the K54 will function as a catalyst for the stimulation of the socio-economic development in Mamelodi and surrounding areas through the provision of a modern road network.“The provincial road and transport department is wholly committed to providing training, skills development and empowering local contractors. The project will see the main contractor sub-contracting work to local small-, medium- and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs),” Vadi said.Construction is expected to take 30 months.
