And it is always difficult to balance the need for more revenue with the need to boost economic growth.“Consequently, we were glad to note that Treasury is not relying solely on increased consumer taxes (VAT, fuel and income taxes) to plug SA’s R48bn hole in tax revenues, having also pledged to cut government spending by R85bn over the next three years.
