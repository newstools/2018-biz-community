Podetti-Ngono says the iValue programme focuses on training learners from as early as Grade 10. The intensive training centres on entrepreneurial skills with a values system infused into behaviour that is intended to foster ethical business conduct.  Podetti-Ngono says while she is pleased that there are more training platforms available in South Africa today that encourage youth to contemplate an entrepreneurial career path, the profit motive must not be placed above ethical business conduct. “It was heart-warming to listen to President Cyril Ramaphosa speak about eradicating corruption at state-owned enterprises. We need to be action oriented in our rule books on how we go about conducting business in our country and firm on what we will no longer tolerate.  “The journey towards embracing ethics in business needs to start during the early stages of education when we introduce entrepreneurship training to our youth."Development processiValue partners include the University of Johannesburg (UJ) and Strate – a South African central securities depository that provides an electronic settlement platform for equities, bonds and money market securities.  Podetti-Ngono says iValue is an enrichment programme, which focuses on providing entrepreneurial skills to preselected Grade 10 learners chosen on the basis of their entrepreneurship character, determination, perseverance and an appetite for risk taking. <img src="/c/1802/431205.jpg" alt="Entrepreneurial initiative teaches business ethics from the start" width="625" height="182">For a period of one year, they learn the value of becoming an entrepreneur, working on a business idea and developing a business plan. During this phase they are mentored by eight students studying small business management at UJ. In year two they present their business plans to a panel of business academics from the university and senior executives from Strate. Business awardAshnee Maharaj, the Chief Financial Officer at Strate, says very stringent criteria have been put in place to ensure that only the most viable business ideas are progressed.  “Only five business plans make it to the next stage of implementation,” says Maharaj, adding that Strate has announced an award of R20,000 that will be given to the two most profitable businesses. 60% of that amount will be re-invested into the business, 10% to be invested in the community, and 30% to be shared amongst the shareholders.” Podetti-Ngono says the iValue programme empowers learners with practical skills that allow youth to identify business opportunities, run a business and solve problems.  “Valued Citizens Initiative is particularly proud of the infusion of ethics to the iValue programme as an essential part of building future business leaders. Sustainable businesses are run along ethical lines, and tomorrow’s business leaders need to learn that today.”
