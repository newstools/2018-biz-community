Speaking at the official launch of the Africa Automation Fair 2019 in Johannesburg this week, stakeholders noted that South Africa was emerging from turbulent times, but said that through collaboration to drive progress, the automation sector could help fast-track economic growth and development. <img src="/c/1802/429887.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429886.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="/c/1802/429889.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429888.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="/c/1802/429891.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429890.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="/c/1802/429893.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429892.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="/c/1802/429895.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429894.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="/c/1802/429897.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429896.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="/c/1802/429899.jpg" alt="Automation industry calls for collaboration to make SA globally competitive" width="350" height="234" rel="/c/1802/429898.jpg?0" data-height="234" data-lwidth="823" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center">The automation sector, now moving toward a digital ‘Industrie 4.0/IIoT’ era, is poised to drive greater efficiencies and make South African enterprises internationally competitive, which will ultimately benefit all South Africans, they said. Oratile Sematle, President of the South African Institute of Measurement and Control (SAIMC), noted that the industry had already progressed to a point where its voice as a collective is now heard in government, institutions and various sectors. “But knowing that if we use automation in the right ways, we can ultimately change the landscape of the South African economy and improve the lives of all people, we need to continue to collaborate to drive further progress, and make South Africa great again,” he said. Marc van Pelt, Chairman of the Industrial Instrumentation Group (IIG) and MD of Pepperl+Fuchs, noted: “As we seek to bring the country to new levels economically, we need to look to automation and smart manufacturing to make our industries competitive on a global basis. At the Connected Industries Conference earlier this year, the sector started the ‘Industrie 4.0/IIoT’ discussion, and the next question is: who is using it? Is the sector ready? As a country, we still have a long way to go.”  Sematle and Van Pelt encouraged industry stakeholders to step up collaborative efforts through forums such as the Africa Automation Fair and Connected Industries Conference, where the sector is able to assess the automation industry’s challenges and seek solutions to support progress.  The Africa Automation Fair, which marks its 21st anniversary in 2019, and the Connected Industries Conference, will expand its scope and reach in 2019, delivering Africa’s largest showcase of industrial automation and control technologies. The event, incorporating the Connected Industries Conference (Industrie 4.0/IIoT), is a focused networking platform for the automation and control industry and works closely with industry associations including the IIG and SAIMC.  In 2019 Africa Automation Fair will host the second edition of the Connected Industries Conference in line with growing international focus on the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the advanced, connected industries of the future. Following the success of AAF 2017 and the Connected Industries Conference, when over 4,000 people from 25 countries attended and 117 companies participated in the three-day event, event organisers Reed Exhibitions plan to grow the fair and conference yet further.  Jayne Harley, GM: Technology & Business events at Reed Exhibitions, announced that in line with a rapidly evolving environment, Africa Automation Fair 2019 will expand its focus across the ecosystem, with new pavilions to be introduced focusing on information security and system integration. The event will also expand its reach to buyers from across Africa, supported by extensive multimedia marketing and public relations campaigns and VIP buyer events.  “We are growing the visitor numbers and reach, and further developing the content, to take the automation industry’s key forum to the next level,” said Carol Weaving, Managing Director at Reed Exhibitions.  Africa Automation Fair is a focused networking platform for the automation and control industry and works closely with industry associations including the IIG, SAIMC and Technews Publishing.  The fair targets senior buyers from South Africa, the rest of Africa and invites participation from international buyers. Presented by Reed Exhibitions, Africa Automation Fair and the Connected Industries Conference and will be staged from 4–6 June 2019 at the Ticketpro Dome, Northgate, Johannesburg.
