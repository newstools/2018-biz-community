Drums, bass, and most guitars were recorded live to capture a certain feel. We spent the rest of the time doing vocals and overdubs. I tried to keep it as natural as I could.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429176.png" alt="Dan Patlansky chats new album" width="625" height="625">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was it like producing the album yourself?Scary, because it’s been some time since I’ve done this. Its also tough being objective when you are prodicing yourself, but I got into the swing of things and trust my gut feel for the most part on what I was hearing. I’m very happy with the album and had a great time getting my production ideas across..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}If you had to describe this album as a meal, what would it be and why?Meat and potatoes with a delicate sauce on top. The core of the album is raw and real, but garnished harmonically. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your favourite track and why?Johnny is my favourite, hence why it’s the opening track. I feel this song captures how I want to come across musically..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does this album differ from previous releases?I think it’s a raw, more organic version of previous releases – the focus is still heavily on songs. It’s just the way those songs are presented to the listener that differs..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your guilty pleasure when it comes to music?I don’t really feel guilty about anything I listen to. I like a whole host of music and don’t mind being judged by others if they disagree.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429174-625x417.jpg" alt="Image by Tobias Coetsee" width="625" height="417">Image by Tobias Coetsee.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s the best and worst thing about being a South African musician?The best thing is coming home to this beautiful country and its great people. The worst part is travelling on a SA passport – it feels more like a criminal record than a passport sometimes..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your favourite emoji?Thumbs up..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next?Well, we tour UK/Europe in March to launch the album, and then we return to SA to tour the album here.danpatlansky.comsetTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
