The series captures pinnacle moments in the race, from the nail-biting Iowa caucuses to the first-in-the-nation Primary in New Hampshire; from the scandals that erupted around Trump’s medical records when Clinton was reported to have pneumonia to the furore around that audio tape; from the candidates’ prep for the debate to the fallout after the fact; from Clinton’s campaign gaining momentum to that fateful moment when it became clear that Trump was going to take it. The heart, the energy, the guts, the triumph and crushing defeat... It’s all there for you to relive, from a non-partisan, objective point of view – no fake news here!
