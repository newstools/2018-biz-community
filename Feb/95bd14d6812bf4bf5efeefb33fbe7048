This is to be achieved within seven years. Seeing as this can be tens of billions of rand, it is a big ask.Apparently, it is now up for debate whether the seven-year mentoring period should be stretched to 10 years to allow for the conditions to be met.Critically, the settlement agreement also stipulates that the mentors must provide financial assistance to the emerging contractors "in the form of guarantees where necessary", another huge ask.Meanwhile, in terms of the public interest, the merging parties submit there will be no adverse effect on employment, as no duplications arise as a result of the mergers.Rather, the affected construction companies will ensure that the transactions provide the emerging contractors with the support, skills and guidance to grow into "successful independent firms in the market".It is important to note that the settlement agreement was brokered by Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel, whose department strongly influences the Competition Commission.It is also important to note that the four construction companies that have agreed to sell at least 40% of equity to emerging parties are equal contributors to the fund.This means that the conditions placed on parties to the settlement agreement are not necessarily complementary.It also raises questions over whether competition policy is further obstructing competition in the country's construction and engineering industry.Source: Business Day
