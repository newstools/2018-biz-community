The nominations committee of the board would soon start looking for a new chairman, the restaurant franchisor said.Ambor has already reduced his interest in the company, having sold his 3-million directly held shares in May 2017. At last count, his family trust owned about 465,000 Spur shares. At current prices, that stake is worth about R12.8m.Ambor opened the first Spur restaurant in Newlands, Cape Town, in 1967. He has been executive chairman of the board since the company was listed on the JSE in 1986."He has overseen the growth of the business from a single outlet to a multibrand franchisor with over 600 restaurants in SA and internationally," group CEO Pierre van Tonder said.<img src="/c/1706/398635-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Allen Ambor, founder and executive chairman of Spur Corporation." width="120" height="120">Spur founder Allen Ambor's tough love approach to businessIconic SA restaurant chain, Spur Steak Ranches, will be 50-years-old in October this year and has grown into an internationally-recognised brand...By Lauren Hartzenberg 26 Jun 2017Spur has materially outperformed the JSE all share index since the turn of the millennium. The stock has risen by a factor of 23 over that time, from R1.19 to R27.50, while the all share index has grown by a factor of seven.But Spur's stock has pulled back from the highs reached in 2015, of around R40, in part because consumers in SA are under increasing pressure.In the six months to end-December, Spur's operating profit margin fell from nearly to 40% to less than 35%, after margins of flagship Spur Steak Ranches and smaller brands such as Panarottis, John Dory's, The Hussar Grill and Captain DoRegos eroded markedly.<img src="/c/1802/430632-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Spur feels the squeeze of low consumer spending" width="120" height="120">Spur feels the squeeze of low consumer spendingRestaurant group Spur on Thursday reported lower first-half earnings, after attracting fewer feet through its doors...By Andries Mahlangu 23 Feb 2018Franchised restaurant sales in the country were 3% lower as political instability and higher living costs negatively affected consumer sentiment and discretionary spending, Van Tonder said last weekSource: Business Day
