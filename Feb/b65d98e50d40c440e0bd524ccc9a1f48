This exciting and innovative project is actually one film with 27 language versions, all of which will be available via the AfriDocs You Tube platform, while the English sub version of the film will be live on the AfriDocs website.The streaming of the film is part of a campaign supported by UNESCO and the filmmakers in honour of International Mother Language Day on February 21.This partnership with the producers of Colours of the Alphabet (COTA) will result in the continent’s first ever simultaneous multi-lingual release of a documentary across the whole of Africa.In-keeping with the subject of the film that explores the challenges faced by children in rural Zambia for receive education in their mother tongue, the film’s producers have created a network of translators who have provided subtitles in 25 indigenous languages for the film.In addition to English, Portuguese and French, this will make the film available in 27 languages across the continent.Colours of the Alphabet producer Higgins has this to say of the partnership with AfriDocs: "We are delighted to be working with AfriDocs and UNESCO to bring this unique documentary film to audiences all across Africa. For many viewers this will be the first time they will see a film subtitled in their own language and we hope this new network of film translators will continue to subtitle films for AfriDocs and others, in what would be a fitting legacy for International Mother Language Day 2018."The release will be accompanied by an online social media campaign, #mytonguemystory, that will allow audiences to share their own stories of mother tongue education in their own languages.To watch all the language versions of Colours of the Alphabet as well as all AfriDocs documentaries visit: https://www.youtube.com/c/AfriDocs.AfriDocs films are FREE to screen anytime and from anywhere in Africa on www.afridocs.net.
