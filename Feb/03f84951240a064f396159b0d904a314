And Danelle Classeen, Sukesh Moodaley, and Siyabonga Ndlebe bolster the Boomtown design force. “Adding young blood to the team enables us as an agency to elevate our creative output, challenge the status quo and drive new ideas,” remarks Boomtown Managing Director Andrew MacKenzie. “From a practical perspective, we have increased our capacity, allowed for areas of focus and investment in talent that shows enormous promise.” Two of the recent appointments come from the agency’s intern programme, Bayeza, which focusses on the development of graduate talent from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. “Sukesh and Pelo underwent a year-long internship with us, and we didn’t want to let them go!” adds MacKenzie. “They’re a huge asset to our junior team and it’s incredibly fulfilling to see them grow.” Within the account management team, there are areas of focus for each new hire: Zanda Twala handles government and parastatal clients, Anina Pienaar handles accounts alongside her new business responsibilities and Pelokazi Mtwisha manages the media buying across all accounts. “By providing areas of focus, our client services team is able to foster, meaningful and mutually beneficial relationships that last. An important part of any business, and advertising is no different,” says MacKenzie.
