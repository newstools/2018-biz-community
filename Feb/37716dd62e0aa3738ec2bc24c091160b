The front design features sleek headlamps, which flow smoothly towards the central focal point by ways of black ‘fins’ flanking the centrally-mounted Toyota emblem. The headlamps themselves feature chrome inner accents.A prominent trapezoidal grille occupies the lower apron complete with honeycomb-patterned screen. The top corners house the Daytime Running Lights (DRL), visually aligned by a slim air aperture. The manufacturer also did a lot to improve the aerodynamics of the car: aero stabilising fins have been incorporated into the rear light clusters which is said to enhance stability by controlling the airflow around the vehicle. The rear bumper design includes aerodynamic fins to smooth airflow within the wheel housing and limit airflow into the rear bumper – in order to reduce aerodynamic drag and improve fuel efficiency.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429192-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Toyota introduces all-new Yaris" width="625" height="325">Seven colours are on offer: diamond silver metallic, attitude black, glacier white, crimson metallic, graphite grey including two new hues - inferno metallic and dark blue metallic.InteriorA cigar-shaped upper dashboard design creates a sense of width which is complemented by the stylised metal accents which surround the air vents. The operation zone is furnished in piano black trim with chrome-plated switchgear.
