Rich past and exciting futureBasson has looked to local flavours and childhood experiences when conceptualising his menu. “We are constantly being inspired by just being South African. We are inspired by our rich past and exciting future,” says Basson. As a gastronomical landscape, South Africa has a hugely diverse range of flavours, techniques, histories and interpretations to draw on; from bunny chows to melktert, braaivleis to pickled fish. This distinctive melting pot of cultures offers a unique taste experience to the world.  “I can’t think of a more exciting time to be cooking South African food, exploring my own food heritage and sharing South Africa with the world,” Basson continues. Stomach and soul satisfied by food and beautyVisser, on the other hand, grew up on a grape farm and, inspired by her mother and grandmother, understood from an early age that in order to be happy, stomach and soul need to be satisfied by food and beauty. She brings this experience to every project, enhancing the local source and identity of the experience. “Using honest ingredients by cultivating great relationships with farmers and producers, suits our country perfectly. We are a nation of farmers, makers and entrepreneurs, people living close to the earth,” says Visser. Based in Cape Town, Visser’s Studio H is known for events such as the Spier Secret Festival and Street Food Festival and the food zine publication and website, Chips! Most recently, Studio H was invited to present its S/Zout project at Dutch Design Week 2017, which consisted of a range of condiments made from salt-tolerant carrots, cabbages, strawberries and tomatoes. Studio H will have Africa’s first 3D food printer on show as part of the Design Indaba line-up. Tickets are available through Webtickets and because seats are limited, booking is essential.
