Once a project is completed, the user has the option of evaluating the service provider by giving them a star-rating on BSA. BSA has elected to remain a neutral party in the selection process. It does not make any endorsements or charge commission on work completed by the suppliers listed on its platform. Any building-related business may list its services on the directory for free. A company is able to enhance its presence on BSA by boosting its listing to ensure that it appears at the top of the relevant category list, but it cannot change the way customers have rated its service. BSA is currently live and available for use in the six main regions of the Western Cape. The network plans to expand its coverage to Gauteng in May 2018, and further afield in the longer term.
