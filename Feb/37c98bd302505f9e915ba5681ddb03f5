Development and empowerment of black-owned business for inclusive growth as well as increasing local content are the main agenda points for future planning. We remain encouraged by some of the packages and incentives created by government for the automotive industry that will create a cascading effect of wealth creation for downstream businesses and communities. As the Business Chamber, we encourage our big businesses to engage in linkages with the smaller businesses in the region”.Commenting on increased production levels, transformation and localisation, Mona said she wanted “the Bay’s automotive economy to lead, innovate and disrupt in these critical areas. One of the major issues for existing investors is an environment characterised by ease of doing business. The Business Chamber will continue to lobby to ensure that the necessary environment and provisions are made for our auto manufacturers”.<img src="/c/1706/397485-120x120.jpg?2" alt="BAIC SA Plant artist impression, a R11bn investment in the Coega SEZ and the biggest single automotive investment in Africa in 40 years." width="120" height="120">Eastern Cape auto industry enters new eraThe decision by Japanese auto assembler Isuzu to buy the General Motors assembly plant in Port Elizabeth and invest in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro is part of a trend...By Dr Ayanda Vilakazi 20 Jun 2017“The Isuzu investment is a much-needed response to mitigate the General Motors South Africa disinvestment which would have been a big blow for the city’s unemployment rate. We are encouraged by the fact that Isuzu would absorb most of these jobs,” she said.The Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies, said: "With its ability to link throughout the economy, the government has identified the automotive industry as a key growth sector. The auto industry is important to the future of manufacturing in this country and whatever emerges in the future will be based on a significant level of support for it going forward. The sector contributes 7.5% of South Africa's Gross Domestic Product and employs about 113,000 people directly. It is key to ensuring greater economic growth."
