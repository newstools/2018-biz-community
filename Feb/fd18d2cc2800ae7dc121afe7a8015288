Black PantherAfter decades of playing an important role in the history of Marvel Comics, Black Panther is finally getting his day on the big screen.It follows T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) who, after the events of Captain America: Civil War, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as king. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as king and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk. Ryan Coogler directs from a screenplay he wrote with Joe Robert Cole, with Chadwick Boseman returning at Black Panther.“The diversity in the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes back to the Marvel comics,” says Marvel Studios president and Black Panther producer Kevin Feige. “I’ve always said we’re just trying to emulate what the comics have been doing so well for so many decades and one of those things is representing society as it exists.  When the Black Panther character debuted in the ‘60s it was a daring move for the Marvel bullpen of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby to introduce this new character, an African character who is smarter than many of our other heroes and is stronger than most of our other heroes. To be able to put that on the big screen fifty years later is incredibly exciting for us.”I, TonyaBased on unbelievable but true events, this darkly comedic tale tells of American figure skater Tonya Harding and one of the most sensational scandals in sports history. Though Harding was the first American woman to complete a triple axel in competition, her legacy was forever defined by her association with an infamous, and even more poorly executed attack on fellow Olympic competitor Nancy Kerrigan. Featuring an iconic turn by Margot Robbie as the fiery Harding, a moustachioed Sebastian Stan as her impetuous ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, a tour-de-force performance from Allison Janney as her acid-tongued mother LaVona Golden.The film is directed by Australian Craig Gillespie, from a screenplay by Steven Rogers.“We really didn’t know what to expect when we screened the movie for Tonya,” says Rogers. “It must be such a strange feeling watching a version of your life portrayed up there on the big screen. But we were all so happy when she wholeheartedly embraced the film. She was actually moved to tears and it was fun for her to watch all her skating routines re-enacted with such close attention to detail. She especially loved the actors’ performances— she thought Margot really captured what it felt like at that time of her life. And she laughed at the jokes, too!”All The Money In The WorldThis captivating thriller follows the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother Gail (Michelle Williams) to convince his billionaire grandfather (Christopher Plummer) to pay the ransom.When Getty Sr. refuses, Gail attempts to sway him as her son’s captors become increasingly volatile and brutal.  With her son’s life in the balance, Gail and Getty’s advisor (Mark Wahlberg) become unlikely allies in the race against time that ultimately reveals the true and lasting value of love over money.Ridley Scott directs from a script written by David Scarpa.“Paul Getty lived a remarkable and yes, cinematic life. A millionaire by the time he was 24, a famous party boy in his youth, hobnobbing with the rich and famous, reckless with his fortune, he eventually returned to the ‘family business’. He became a disciplined, ruthless capitalist but also a patron of art and architecture. Among other accomplishments, he was the mastermind behind the recreation of Hadrian’s Villa we know today as The Getty Villa in Malibu, California. Getty was a man of many contradictions – unfathomably rich and relentlessly cheap, loving and cruel.”FolliesFollies is a classic but rarely-performed musical by Stephen Sondheim, writer of many famous musicals including Sweeney Todd and A Little Night Music.
