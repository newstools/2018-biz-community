Eight hard years later, we could see the band breakthrough and become a household name.They are on an upward curve having shared the stage with the likes of Chad Saaiman, the Black Ties, and  Auriol Hays.The band released their debut album called Alt Ego, late last year. I caught up with the duo, last week.<img src="/c/1802/430002-625x417.jpg" alt="#MusicExchange: Acoustic Element" width="625" height="417">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When are you happiest?I’d say we’re at our happiest when we’re halfway through our set and the audience is feeling our vibe. There’s no better feeling than grabbing the attention of an audience with the violin and guitar..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does music mean to you?Music is our lives! We’ve been very fortunate that since the inception of Acoustic Element we’ve been blessed with a huge number of gigs. We average between five to seven gigs per week and have been doing so for a number of years now. Although this is hard work, and very tiring, we don’t feel like we have worked a day in our lives (since leaving our corporate jobs in 2014). .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any funny moments on stage?Once, we were playing at a big market in Constantia and the wind was howling. We were playing in front of a huge umbrella and at one point the wind took it off its weight and it came flying and just missed Jody’s head – he only realised it once it was too late but he definitely would’ve gone off to hospital.I guess that’s not funny, though.Once in Durban, at a show, women were groping at our legs while we were jamming in front of a few thousand people. That was quite awkward to handle.We also once saw a naked man from a New Year's Eve gig at the Mount Nelson, the stage was set up next to the pool, in front of the windows of many of the rooms and an old man came out of the shower to get some fresh air and we were unfortunately in plain site! It was classic!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Your heroes? Goldfish. Goodluck. Clean Bandit.
