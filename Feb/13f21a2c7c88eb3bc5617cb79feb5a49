The study states: “South Africa is host to approximately one million international business events delegates annually whose primary purpose of visit is to attend meetings, convention, conference or exhibition.”Developing a rotational strategyBird notes that leisure visitors to the country tend to spend their own money when travelling here, whereas business delegates tend to travel on company money and have a larger amount of disposable income as their accommodation, flights, and conference expenses are taken care of. This allows them extra budget for shopping, excursions, and leisure travel within the country.Bird believes there is more that can be done by the southern African conference and exhibition industry in terms of developing a rotational strategy for major global business events, both within South Africa, between the major cities, as well as within the SADC countries. “When major events are rotating within a region, it stimulates the growth of the size of the pie, rather than growth in the number of slices in the same-size pie.”The theme of this year’s Meetings Africa 2018, ‘Shared Economies’, echoes this perspective. Meetings Africa, which is Africa’s premier business events trade show, takes place at Sandton Convention Centre from 26 to 28 February. Confex events and its importance in AfricaChief Convention Bureau officer at SA Tourism, Amanda Kotze-Nhlapo reinforces the importance of the business events industry to the continent’s economy: “The Shared Economies theme is a critical component of the work that our industry does, which is way beyond tourism. The goal this year is to expand the overall conversation and focus on how collaboration can help us find innovative solutions to bettering the lives of our people.”<img src="/c/1802/430488-625x417.jpg" alt="Image via" width="625" height="417">Image via Tsogo Sun - Sandton ConventionCentreMeetings Africa is an iconic industry event that showcases Africa’s diverse offering of services and products and offers a platform for African associations and meetings industry professionals to partner to help transform the continent.“Meetings Africa is the continent’s largest business tourism event and has been a signature event on the SCC calendar for 12 years. Last year we were proud to win the bid to host Meetings Africa for the next five years, which we believe reflects the growing success of these events,” comments Bird.
