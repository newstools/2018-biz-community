We are truly enjoying having her as part of our team,” says Jeanette Grove, Social Media Head, at Grey South Africa.“I was first exposed to the industry through the local drama show Generations. The show centres around an advertising agency and the day to day activities thereof. I grew up playing Generations with my friends, which in turn means that the seed to pursue advertising as a career was planted deep within me from an early age,” says Dineo. Dineo lives her life by two mottos. One is from her favourite movie The Shawshank Redemption: “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” - Andy Dufresne. And “In a world where you can be anything, be kind”.
