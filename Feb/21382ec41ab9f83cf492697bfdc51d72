The department, led by the Minister, Deputy Minister Enver Surty and Director-General Mathanzima Mweli made the announcement when it briefed Parliament’s Portfolio Committee for Basic Education on its state of readiness. The SGB elections, which begin tomorrow, are the largest election process outside of the Local Government Elections and take place in over 25,000 public schools. SGBs serve their schools for a three-year cycle wherein they make important decisions regarding issues around discipline in schools and codes of conduct, to language and admissions policies at a school level. “The importance of this structure in our schools emanates from the important role parents and communities need to play in the education of their children,” said the department. According to the department, the election of SGBs is one of the flagships of the education sector that has to be prioritised by all provinces in terms of planning, budget allocation and the allocation of both physical human resources.  “Governing bodies have a strategic significance, as identified by the National Development Plan (NDP), which calls for the alignment of the interests of all stakeholders to support the common goal of achieving good educational outcomes that are responsive to community needs and economic development,” said Minister Motshekga.  The department encouraged parents to participate in the elections, adding that they contribute to the development of a strong sense of community ownership. “The performance of schools tends to improve when parents are actively involved and take an interest in the affairs of the school. “The most important thing now is for parents to turn up in their numbers to meet the required meeting thresholds so that the elections can take place and adequately represent the school community,” said the Minister.
