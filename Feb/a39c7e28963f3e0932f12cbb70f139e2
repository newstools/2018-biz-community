The Belmond brand continues to gain momentum and this acquisition marks the latest step in our journey towards realising our strategic growth plan. We believe this stunning castle, steeped in Etruscan history, builds on our past experience of acquiring distinctive, timeless properties and restoring them to their iconic status through strategic investment. Belmond Castello di Casole fully encapsulates ‘The Art of Good Living’, combining culture, nature and wellbeing to create memorable travel experiences and special occasion events.A storied pastSteeped in history, Belmond Castello di Casole dates back to the 10th century, owned by Italian aristocratic family, the Bargalis, who for generations farmed the landscape and latterly by acclaimed cinematographer Luchino Visconti whose films The Leopard and Death in Venice embody the ‘Golden Age of Cinema’. Visconti’s parties at the castle were legendary, attended by Hollywood glitterati.Multi-sensory escapismThe hotel’s spacious all-suite rooms are all designed to honour the rich and rustic traditions of Tuscany, full of terracotta and golden colours with period antique furnishings and original stone floors. Many feature private gardens that blossom with aromatic white roses in summer.The heated outdoor infinity pool offers sweeping views across the golden hills and valleys of Tuscany and guests can enjoy a range of activities within the rich natural countryside including truffle hunting, mastering the genuine art of Tuscan cooking, hiking and cycling through the estate’s 100 acres of vineyards and olive groves as well as its neighbouring hamlets. The spa, located in the vaulted wine cellar, features restored stone walls and Etruscan artefacts. Belmond expects to invest €7.3m ($9m) in a phased refurbishment of the hotel over four years, including the addition of two new villas, bringing the resort’s total key count to 41.
