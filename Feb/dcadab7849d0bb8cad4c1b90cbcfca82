Writers Writers are producing new content for publication on their own website or writing to order for clients who plan to publish it on the web or in book form. Knowledgeable clients want to make sure that they’re paying for original work and will often run their own checks to verify the content is clear of problems before paying for it. Should something get flagged, it can lead to heated arguments and non-payment costing the writer money, future deals and a bad reputation. Avoiding having problems with clients because one or two phrases were used in a piece of writing that matches online content written on the same topic is necessary. It’s better to be safe than sorry because asking for forgiveness later under the circumstances is unlikely to work out. If issues with false flags do come up regularly on product names and quotes, then it’s a good idea to make the client aware of that ahead of time too. Educators The educational establishment can make use of the plagiarismcheck.org project to verify that student submissions are wholly original pieces of work. It will check to see if the submitted essays draw helpfully on past works and may quote from them reasonably, or whether repeated phrases constitute copying by students. Educators cannot know every relevant published book, peer reviewed paper, or online content on a given topic to spot the copies from the mass of submissions, so a plagiarism checker is invaluable. Students Writing a college paper and submitting it used to be simple, but now there’s so much content out there that it’s easy to write something that uses a phrase or two of something already online. After all, when it comes to writing about dry, academic-based topics, there’s only so many ways to say something. With some plagiarism checkers, they find duplications or suspected ones when repeating a phrase or a quote from someone. Indeed, even a full product name comes up as a duplicate when it’s clearly just the name of a commercial product on some plagiarism checking software tools. Other checkers are more sophisticated and understand that a quote is used in student essays and doesn’t constitute plagiarism. Checking school or college work before submitting it is important to avoid accusations that could be baseless but cause a suspension or an expulsion due to an accidental duplication that the educational institute overreacts on. When your future is at stake, it doesn’t pay to take unnecessary risks. Journalists The trusty journalist wants their writing to hit the mark with readers by capturing their interest, triggering their emotions and lifting their spirits on their way to work in the morning. The last thing they need is a regular reader of their column spotting something in their writing that reminds them of a previously published book, academic paper or article and accusing them publicly of copying it. For their editor, the situation might be even worse if they spot a problem with their latest article being checked being scheduling it for publication, as they’ll have to decide what punitive action to take. Checking writing to see whether it’s an original work or something with passages lifted from somewhere else is useful in many vocations. Whether to protect a reputation from harm or just to cover all the bases, checking copy for issues is just smart.
