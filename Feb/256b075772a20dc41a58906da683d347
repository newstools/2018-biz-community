Now in its fifth year, the Warc 100 is based on a rigorous methodology developed in consultation with Douglas West, professor of marketing at Kings College London.The top-ranked campaign, 'Dads #ShareTheLoad' by BBDO India for Ariel Matic, Procter & Gamble's premium laundry detergent brand, built on its previous 'Share the Load' campaign by persuading dads to do more laundry in order to promote gender equality. Ariel Matic generated a 42% increase in unaided brand awareness, $12.3m in earned media coverage, and conversations on social media and sales growth exceeding previous campaigns.In second place is 'The Swedish Number' by INGO Stockholm for The Swedish Tourist Association, which manages hotels and hostels across Sweden. The purely PR-driven approach saw more than 32,000 Swedes sign up to take more than 200,000 calls from abroad helping STF boost its renewal figures and attract new members.Ranked third is the 'Care Counts' campaign for Whirlpool by DigitasLBi Chicago. The appliances manufacturer installed washers and dryers in schools to give disadvantaged students access to laundry facilities, resulting in 90% of the participants increasing their school attendance rate. The programme has been expanded to nearly 60 schools across the US.Three themes have emerged from the world's top effectiveness campaigns: Purpose is effective when brands have a credible role. Three purpose-driven campaigns appear in the top 10. 'Dads #ShareTheLoad' for Ariel, Whirlpool's 'Care Counts' and 'Imagine the Possibilities' for Barbie are all examples of the commercial success that can be driven when a brand's purpose is intrinsically linked to its product.Strategies with PR baked in are becoming the norm. Three campaigns in the top ten used a PR-led strategy to drive brand awareness and increase sales: 'Meet Graham' for Australia's Transport Accident Commission, Burger King's 'The McWhopper Proposal' and 'Van Gogh BnB' for the Art Institute of Chicago.New takes on long-term ideas. Several of the highly effective initiatives ranked, such as 'Dads #ShareTheLoad', 'Hungerithm' for Snickers, the John Lewis Christmas campaigns and Always' 'Girl Emojis', show how blockbuster ideas can be intelligently followed up with brands investing in long-term strategies rather than quick wins for immediate gain.Smarter thinking unleashes the power of creativityAustralia's Clemenger BBDO Melbourne tops the creative agencies for effectiveness table for the first time having produced two top 10 campaigns: 'Meet Graham' and 'Hungerithm'. New Zealand's Colenso BBDO follows in second place with work for Burger King and DB Export contributing to their score.Starcom Chicago has returned to the top of the media agencies for effectiveness ranking with almost triple the points of the second-placed agency.Eight of the top digital/specialist agencies for effectiveness are from the US, with Chicago-based agencies making up the top three. DigitasLBi Chicago takes poll position. BBDO Worldwide remains the most awarded network for the fifth year in a row, having retained this rank since Warc 100 began in 2014. Its agencies contributed to four of the top 10 campaigns and 19 of the top 100.Andrew Robertson, president and chief executive, BBDO Worldwide, says: "Smarter thinking unleashes the power of creativity to make greater impact. That's why leading the Warc 100 is so meaningful."For the second time, Omnicom Group is the most awarded holding company, having previously held top position in 2014. Omnicom Group owns four of the top 10 agency networks.Producing great workJohn Wren, president and CEO, Omnicom Group, says: "Producing great work that drives results for our clients is why we come to work every day. It is especially gratifying to see Omnicom recognised by Warc as having five of the top ten individually ranked agencies, three of the top five networks, and being the top-ranked holding company. I could not be prouder of our teams."Burger King improved its ranking by 30 places to reach the top brand for effectiveness, with the 'McWhopper Proposal' campaign in the top 10 and 'Backyard Burger King' in the top 100. The continuing performance of Ariel's 'Share the Load' campaign has contributed to the brand retaining its second place.Unilever was the most effective advertiser for the third time, having previously held this top position in 2015 and 2014. Unilever has four campaigns in the top 100 - Lifebuoy's '#HelpAChildReach5', Knorr's 'Love At First Taste', 'The Vaseline Healing Project' and 'The radicalisation of Persil' - with a further 50 campaigns across all competitions contributing to its tally.Campaigns with purposeKeith Weed, chief marketing and communications officer, Unilever, says: "It's a great honour to be recognised by Warc as Most Effective Advertiser again. I'm hugely proud of our marketers, working hard to drive campaigns with purpose that cut through to consumers and make a real impact."USA retains its place as the top country in the world with 36 of the top 100 campaigns, compared to 12 from the UK and 12 from Australia.The most highly ranked campaigns and companies in Warc 100 are:Top 10 world's top effectiveness campaignsRankCampaign titleBrandAgencyPoints1Dads #ShareTheLoadArielBBDO Mumbai127.12The Swedish NumberSwedish Tourist AssociationINGO Stockholm95.43Care CountsWhirlpoolKetchum Chicago84.64Meet GrahamTransport Accident CommissionClemenger BBDO82.55=The McWhopper ProposalBurger KingMelbourne80.75=Van Gogh BnBArt Institute of ChicagoY&R Auckland80.77HungerithmSnickersLeo Burnett Chicago78.98John Lewis Christmas CampaignsJohn LewisClemenger BBDO Melbourne78.49RewordHeadspace National Youth Mental Health Foundationadam&eveDDB72.210Imagine the PossibilitiesBarbieLondon70.0Top 5 creative agencies for effectivenessRankAgencyLocationPoints1Clemenger BBDO MelbourneMelbourne, Australia186.62Colenso BBDOAuckland, New Zealand174.23BBDO New YorkNew York, USA139.84BBDO IndiaMumbai, India124.95Droga5New York, USA114.9Top 5 media agencies for effectivenessRankAgencyLocationPoints1StarcomChicago, USA269.62MindshareIstanbul, Turkey86.33Spark FoundryChicago, USA77.94PHDShanghai, China76.45Manning Gottlieb OMDLondon, UK65.5Top 5 digital/specialist agencies for effectivenessRankAgencyLocationPoints1DigitasLBiChicago, USA90.72KetchumChicago, USA84.63Leo Burnett/Arc WorldwideChicago, USA79.94Weber ShandwickNew York, USA54.45Team Unilever ShopperNew York, USA51.1Top 5 agency networks for effectivenessRankNetworkPoints1BBDO Worldwide1454.92Ogilvy & Mather Advertising7383McCann Worldgroup699.14DDB Worldwide553.45OMD Worldwide536.4Top 5 holding companies for effectivenessRankHolding companyPoints1Omnicom Group3472.72WPP3220.63Interpublic Group2157.24Publicis Groupe1944.15Dentsu425.5Top 5 brands for effectivenessRankBrandPoints1Burger King153.32Ariel127.13Mastercard120.84IBM103.65Vodafone101.1Top 5 advertisers for effectivenessRankAdvertiserPoints1Unilever5052PepsiCo398.63Mars3394Procter & Gamble327.95Heineken265.3Top 5 countries for effectivenessRankCountryPoints1USA3360.12UK1478.33Australia949.94India630.85New Zealand531.8The Warc 100 is now part of Gunn Report, which recently published Gunn 100, a ranking of campaigns and companies based on creativity.Creative approaches translate to marketplace successCommenting on Warc 100, Emma Wilkie, managing director, Gunn Report, says: "This year's Warc 100 once again confirms that creative approaches to marketing translates into marketplace success, with nearly all the top 10 campaigns also recognised in Gunn 100.
