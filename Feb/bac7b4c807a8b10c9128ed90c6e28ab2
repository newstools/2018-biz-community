The misters and bird songs had motion sensors that activated “moments of natural refreshments” which naturally reduced commuters stress as they waited for their daily transport. <img src="/c/1802/430056.jpg" alt="Moments of natural refreshment with Strongbow" width="310" height="160" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="/c/1802/430058.jpg" alt="Moments of natural refreshment with Strongbow" width="310" height="160" rel="">click to enlargeThe #NatureRemix campaign was supported by out-of-home posters, online ads and films which increased its effectiveness in spreading awareness, attracting a new audience and targeting its current audience. With audio-visual capturing consumer reactions, #NatureRemix was implemented to positively affect commuters lives and to remind them about the beauty in taking a step back and enjoying moments with nature when city life becomes all-consuming.
