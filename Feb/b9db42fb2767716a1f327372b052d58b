"It’s hard not to be mesmerised by this little masterpiece," says Clerke. "Straight from the streets of Gotham City (well, the MTN version at least), it is as enjoyable to watch as it probably was tiring to make – very. Especially post. The grade is clean, crisp and fresh, seeing the compulsory MTN yellow in a new light – literally. A glowing yellow orb that floats around the streets, bringing to life the world of music, gaming and memes that sit within your smartphone. The attention to detail is super – with only one or two things that could be neatened up (like the yellow on the girl’s face at the end). But who’s counting? Not that this has anything to do with the grade – but it’s worth mentioning that the ad is cleverly and intentionally cut to the music, making for a watchable piece of content that almost makes me forget how much MTN data I used to consume it."Special mentions for the month also went to:Showmax Tali’s Wedding Diary ‘Makeup Advice’ by Ari Kruger from Sketchbook Studios – Direction CraftSter Kinekor ‘The Reign of Ian’ by Grant de Sousa from They Shoot Films – Direction CraftSanlam ‘2-Minute Shower’ by Jeremy de Tolly from We Love Jam – Remixes of existing tracks / Music Production CraftTo view all the winners and entries visit iDidThtEditorial.com.Every month iDidTht.com teams up with a top local creative director to award the best in film craft by leading production companies in South Africa.
