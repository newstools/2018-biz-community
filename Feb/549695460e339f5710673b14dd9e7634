A suspicious container was removed from the ship and inspected after two Sars Customs sniffer dogs indicated the possible concealment of endangered species products in the container.”The container was found to have 156 boxes of frozen abalone hidden amongst other items.The frozen boxes of abalone were handed over to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the Hawks for further investigation.
