The festival’s executive producer Ashraf Johaardien says, “We received an overwhelming number of high-calibre proposals for consideration. Whittling these down to match the available space and resources at our disposal was no mean feat but the artistic committee tackled this gargantuan task with gusto and I feel confident that audiences can look forward to a bold but balanced programme of work that will both entertain and provoke."Confirmed worksThe confirmed works that will be on show at the National Arts Festival include Steven Cohen’s performance art piece put your heart under your feet… and walk! / to Elu; an intense meditation on loss, grief and absence, following the death of Cohen’s partner and artistic collaborator, the choreographer Elu. This work takes the form of a performance, a two-screen projection and an installation of sculptural objects. A myriad pointe shoes invoke Elu's absence and are collaged with other found objects embedded with histories, ideologies, beliefs, many of them recurrent images in Cohen’s artistic lexicon.<img src="/c/1802/431202-625x462.jpg" alt="Image by Pierre Planchenault" width="625" height="462">Image by Pierre PlanchenaultMary Watson’s Jungfrau will be presented in partnership with Festival Theaterformen (Germany).
