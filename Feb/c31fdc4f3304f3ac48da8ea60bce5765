And it’s a great feeling to be part of a company that encourages and enables its employees to pursue their dreams.”Etihad Airways acknowledged Andrew’s achievement with a reception at its Abu Dhabi headquarters, where the record breaker shared a video and experience of his marathon round-the-world journey.Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways chief executive officer, added: “On behalf of employees across the company, I congratulate Andrew for this remarkable achievement. This feat requires significant commitment, dedication and perseverance – values that we at Etihad instil in all our employees, and we are extremely proud to have Andrew as a member of our Etihad family.”A record in the makingThe New Zealander who joined Etihad Airways in 2007, and who has a passion for studying airline route networks and schedules, meticulously charted his journey. He targeted the record for over 20 years and was first keen to attempt to break it as a teenager.“With the advent of new longer range and fuel-efficient aircraft over the years, airlines have been able to introduce non-stop long-haul flights and add frequencies that facilitated my record-breaking attempt,” commented Fisher.“Planning the trip was a matter of identifying the most suitable qualifying antipodal city pairs and then finding the best routes, schedules and tightest possible connections within the right window of opportunity.”
