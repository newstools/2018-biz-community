Unsilo.me offers a complete set of business tools with the best features that exist in other CRM's, Project Management, Human Resource Management, Communication and Analytics tools, all within one solution. “As a small team we asked ourselves why we had multiple logins, were paying multiple subscription costs, had data living across multiple platforms and were accepting varying user experiences,” Yreeka MD and Co-founder Mathew HaswellThe team soon realised that this was a problem that other businesses were experiencing as well and decided to solve this by designing and building a platform. Unsilo.me is a platform where you can get all you need to manage and scale your business in one place for a fraction of the cost.<img src="/c/1802/429842.gif" alt="The integrated platform that's changing the way businesses work" width="625" height="378">“It just seemed strange to us to that there weren’t more solutions that we could find that offered us the integration we needed as a business across our core processes, so we decided to have a go, breakdown silo’s and build one.” said Haswell By solving this frustration Unsilo.me aims at providing users with an all-in-one solution that has been intuitively designed to empower users to efficiently manage and scale their businesses in a cost-effective manner. <img src="/c/1802/429843.gif" alt="The integrated platform that's changing the way businesses work" width="625" height="378">Unsilo.me is currently in production and the team are asking anyone who is interested in the product to sign up for early access to receive a 14-day free trial when it launches.Sign up for early access!
