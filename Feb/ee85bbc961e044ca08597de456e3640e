The country can no longer afford the disaster that is the state owned enterprises because it has brought us to the brink of financial ruin. The bloated cabinet and state expenditure needs to be brought under control with some urgency.<img src="/c/1802/430388-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Budget2018: Sturdy budget promises firm roots for green shoots" width="120" height="120">#Budget2018: Sturdy budget promises firm roots for green shootsAccording to Berry Everitt, CEO of the Chas Everitt International property group, Wednesday's Budget Speech contained some very hopeful elements for SA's property sector...21 hours agoBy taxing the very people who are growing the economy, we are making it very difficult for business owners and entrepreneurs to feel positive about investing further into the economy. Uncertainty about property ownership is also concerning.Postive messages must translate into actionAlthough the succession of Cyril Ramaphosa as ANC and SA president has seen the mood in the country turn increasingly positive and his SONA 2018 address has sent the right messages, we need to see this translate into action. We need a return to economic and political stability so that investors can feel confident about investing and growing the economy.<img src="/c/1802/430386-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Budget2018: Tough budget positive for property market in medium to long term" width="120" height="120">#Budget2018: Tough budget positive for property market in medium to long termWednesday's Budget Speech, delivered by minister of finance Malusi Gigaba, is likely to prove positive for the property market in the medium to long term, says Gerhard Kotzé, MD of the RealNet...22 hours agoThe effect of weak confidence has been evident in the property market. Since last year there has been an accelerating decline in activity, especially at the upper end of the price scale, being above R8m in Gauteng and above R18m in the Cape. Those who do not need to sell or buy are preferring to hold back. This means fewer transactions and a decline in transfer duty paid to government.While the year has started on a more positive note, people need to see that government and economic mismanagement is being addressed and need reassurance that their investments and property will be safe. Remember, the property sector is a vital contributor to the economy, jobs and prosperity, but it needs a good economy to thrive.
