"There is an issue of illegal settlers at Jumbo Mine and we need to find alternative land for those people," said Mr Kadaira. "We are hopeful that through the downsizing of farms exercise, we will get adequate land to relocate people at Manzou Farm and give them a hectare each."In 2002 and 2004, A2 farmers were given land without offer letters, we want them to get the letters."Functioning district lands committees crucialChairperson of the provincial lands committee and Minister of State for Provincial Affairs Advocate Martin Dinha said district lands committees, which were disbanded were crucial and had started functioning. "District lands committees were no longer functional due to lack of cooperation from the relevant ministry," he said. "Under the new dispensation of President Mnangagwa and the Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Retired Air Chief Marshal Perrance Shiri, they now meet every week to deal with land issues."We want an audit on all the land distributed last year. The issues here are that people were given offer letters for already occupied land, people were resettled around dams."Correct those mistakes and we want a progress report. We want a proper land allocation process. We want the list of farms you want to downsize, you heard what the president said in Mvuma."We will downsize to below 450 hectares and also according to the production record of the farmer. This is the last phase of the land reform programme, we want to get to the production stage and we cannot continue allocating land."A Namibian based investor Fungai Mushangwe approached the committee with a cattle ranching proposal. "I am here to support command livestock and I want to import Boer goats and other cattle breeds to support other farmers," he said.Read the original article on The Herald.
