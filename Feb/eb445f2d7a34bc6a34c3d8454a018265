MC Michael Bierut, in signature pale suit with graphic tie, in his soothing dulcet American tones once again called it the best conference in the world as it's where you see the future first, which is why he’s been attending for a decade – he added:Design Indaba is not just a platform to talk, but a place for action, as the three days of conferencing inspire 362 days of doing.<img src="/c/1602/331646-120x120.jpg?2" alt="[Design Indaba 2016] All the feels" width="120" height="120"> All the feelsBar the handful of invited media, the bulk of Design Indaba attendees don't act like screen-obsessed workplace millennials...By Leigh Andrews 18 Feb 2016Bierut reminded us that Design Indaba founder Ravi Naidoo intends for Design Indaba to drive a better world through creativity, not just through the annual festival that’s a must for many the world over, but also through its online publication and design activism projects.

Touching on trends like Afrofuturism, innovation where traditional procedure is the norm and invention that goes beyond the ordinary, speakers will wow attendees over the next three days and hopefully leave them with a renewed sense of their purpose in the world around them.    2 days and 3 timezones later.

Calling Durban ‘Doobun’, Bierut mentioned that simulcast attendees there and in Johannesburg, Potchefstroom, Port Elizabeth, while also sold out in Cape Town, were in for a great experience. Bierut pointed out that sponsors Woolworths, Mercedes Benz, Liberty and Business Insider had made what we were about to see possible, warranting a round of applause.<img src="/c/1711/420057-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Design Indaba 2016." width="120" height="120">Design Indaba Conference, a multi-sensory eventThe Design Indaba Conference, which will be held from 21-23 February 2018, is going beyond design to create a multi-sensory event where you can hear, see, learn and experience the future of creative thinking and design activism...23 Nov 2017Then it was time for the speakers...Keep your eyes peeled for our coverage throughout, which will all be packed in our Design Indaba newsletter, hitting your inbox this Monday, and will feature in our special section on site throughout the year.
