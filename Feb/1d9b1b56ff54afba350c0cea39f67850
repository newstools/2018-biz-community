Scopen Global holds the majority of the shares; Mazole is a minority shareholder. Johanna McDowell is a director of Scopen Africa, as is Cesar Vacchiano, global CEO of Scopen.]While margins may well be growing tighter, agencies are being forced to look further afield for more business. I’ve noticed that many agencies, especially in Cape Town, have a number of international clients and can compete aggressively for business based on price and talent.DigitalMore and more marketers will handle more and more digital marketing in-house, I believe, not just because it’s more cost-efficient in some ways but also because they want to understand the role of digital more closely and believe that one of the barriers which they have is lack of knowledge. As the digital demands within and across the business grow, the percentage of dedicated digital marketers within the marketing department should increase from about 25% to 35% in the next 12 months.ROIThe above trend directly links back to return on investment (ROI). This will also become a more and more important focus for both marketers and agencies. Marketers love digital marketing as they can see an immediate result, which links to consumer engagement and sales. This helps to prove the value of marketing and advertising. ROI will become more and more sophisticated over the next 12 months as the growth in digital channels continues to flourish.<img src="/c/1712/423173-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Some of the House of Brave team." width="120" height="120">The true definition of ROI: Return on Investment, Ideas, Insight and InnovationWith six successful years under its belt, House of Brave co-founder and ECD Vanessa Pearson shares what makes them a top-five SA agency with first-rate strategic planning and digital effectiveness, as per Scopen's AgencyScope 2017/18...By Leigh Andrews 19 Dec 2017Talent in agenciesAll over the world, agencies talk about the shortage of skills and talent in the industry. Does this mean that advertising as an industry is becoming less attractive to potential recruits? Or are there too many other options? This will be debated at length here and globally for some time to come.<img src="/c/1711/418668.jpg" alt="Promise top five in SA for client satisfaction (Scopen Agency Scope 2017/18)" width="120" height="120">Promise top five in SA for client satisfaction (Scopen Agency Scope 2017/18)Promise has been voted by clients as a foremost agency in South Africa for client satisfaction.

It’s not necessarily being viewed as such here but I believe that SA will follow the rest of the global ad world and that marketers will be demanding far greater levels of transparency in media — especially with digital expenditure. Media-spend reporting and media audits will mushroom.BEE and transformationThere is lots of talk about this issue and a number of transactions and transformation initiatives etc are in place across the industry. Partnerships will form in this area during the early part of 2018 — and some of these might be borne out of desperation or need. I hope that most of these will be borne rather from desire to partner and a willingness to share growth and economic transformation.<img src="/c/1711/418208.jpg" alt="Promise first in SA for dedication to BEE (Scopen Agency Scope 2017/18)" width="120" height="120">Promise first in SA for dedication to BEE (Scopen Agency Scope 2017/18)Promise has been voted by clients as the leading agency in South Africa for commitment to Black Economic Empowerment and Transformation...Issued by Promise 10 Nov 2017DurbanThe coastal city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal is seeing something of a resurgence in creativity and innovation among the local agencies.
