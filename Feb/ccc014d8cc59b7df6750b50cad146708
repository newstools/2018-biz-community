He said the council was "better equipped" than Metrorail to do this.Metrorail would use a new product developed by the Department of Environmental Affairs, made of alien vegetation, to build walls on either side of the rail reserve for 15km."The construction cost will amount to about R45m," said Swartz."The wall will be constructed with alien plant biomass and is fire-resistant, bulletproof, strong, quick to build and cheaper than other options considered to date," said Swartz."If we use the product " we can save R20m."Source: Business Day
