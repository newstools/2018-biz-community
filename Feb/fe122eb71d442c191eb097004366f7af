The brief was to develop an architectural personality with elements that were distinct and synonymous with the new Back’s brand, allowing it to be scalable for future franchise opportunities. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428832.jpg" alt="By SWPhotography" width="625" height="417">By SWPhotography'Nouveau meets modern organic'Renee de Waal, founder and managing director of Xperiencemakers, describes the style at Back’s as ‘nouveau meets modern organic’: “There is a strong interplay of organic materials set against a white and very fresh background. The entire experience is designed to reflect something fresh and wholesome, with installations that create numerous pockets of surprise.”From the signage, through to custom-designed wallpapers and upholstery fabric, as well as shop-fittings and furniture elements that were crafted for the space, every aspect was considered for the purposes of being translated to future franchise locations. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428833.jpg" alt="By SWPhotography" width="625" height="417">By SWPhotography“The inspiration for Back’s came from my long lineage of farming history, with the fundamental basis of everything I do being integrity and quality," says Back. "Thanks to Renee’s great aesthetic and international knowledge, I feel she has successfully brought the Back’s image to life, meticulously integrating organic elements with a space that is light, welcoming and tasteful. When you leave Back’s, we hope you leave feeling inspired to make even the smallest change towards a healthier, more harmonious existence with our land, our animals and our communities. If so, we know we’ve done our job.”
