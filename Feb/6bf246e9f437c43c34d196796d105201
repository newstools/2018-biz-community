Although inspired by everyday classics, the idea of trends within symbolism and universal imagery diversifies our style. But we have always drawn inspiration and influence from everywhere, anything and everything!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think about the plagiarism claims made about your AW18 collection? We never intended to offend anyone. We are well aware of the use other fashion houses have made of such universal imagery. While we are constantly inspired by various sources and such universal imagery, we take pride in the fact that all our designs are originally ours and unique to our style as the Rosey & Vittori brand. We respect and admire all fashion houses. We were simply interpreting trends and hailing those that inspire us.<img src="/c/1802/429571.jpg" alt="Rosey &amp; Vittori's Steven Rosenbau talks inspiration, SA fashion and SAMW" width="600" height="455">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s the biggest misconception about being a fashion designer?

It’s tough getting into the market as a young design house. There might be a plethora of fashion creatives and a lot that sets them apart from other designers, but who is there to channel, guide, sculpt and assist them in turning that creativity into a workable, profitable business model? We don't feel that the ‘business of fashion’ is taken as seriously as it should be in South Africa. <img src="/c/1802/429572.jpg" alt="Rosey &amp; Vittori's Steven Rosenbau talks inspiration, SA fashion and SAMW" width="600" height="455">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you give someone trying to enter the fashion industry?  Give it horns! Start from the bottom - read fashion magazines, follow trends and blogs and browse shopping malls as often as you can. Work at a local retail store or boutique. Intern where you can in order to understand the basics. You start to pick up what's hot and what not, what works and what doesn't. Do your best to craft your own brand signature/handwriting – it will always evolve, as the times do. And before you know it, you're establishing your own brand and pushing boundaries!  Many people will say many things, some that build you up and others that go out of your way to tear you down. Its tough and sometimes very frustrating, but the reward is well worth it because you're living what you love!Visit Rosey & Vittori online to learn more, and connect with the brand on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
