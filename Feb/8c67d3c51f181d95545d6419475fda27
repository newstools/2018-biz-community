Find information sources that will keep you sharp and in the know.Why do you love what you do?I love the work I do at Digify Africa because it is all about re-imagining education. It's turning the traditional ways of doing things on its head. I love it because days are unpredictable, new technological advancements force us to innovate and think of ways we can use them to better our offering. Lastly, there is nothing more rewarding than seeing how learning new skills has changed so many of our students and participants' lives. I've seen students who were depressed and feeling like they had no career options graduate and go on to manage massive accounts and become incredibly valuable additions to an agency's creative team.What superpower do you bring to the industry?I have an insatiable curiosity and an incredibly strategic mind...I wish my superpower was something fun like mind-reading or teleportation though.
