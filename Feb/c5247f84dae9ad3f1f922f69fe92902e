Big systems, different ways of working, but I adapted to the small nimble way of doing things and I think it’s this approach that I can bring into TBWA. Openco has been a great place to learn and make things happen. We won a few pieces of business but the agency is always one that can deliver, no matter the task. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1701/374455-120x120.jpg" alt="Carl Willoughby" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2017: The ad industry needs more beautiful storiesThe advertising industry needs more work that stands out, "beautiful stories", says Carl Willoughby, executive creative director of OpenCo...By Carl Willoughby 10 Jan 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career?Ideas. Finding a better way to say something, or do something. The opportunity to create, to change perception. The ability to influence behaviour. I also love the fact that we keep learning. That things keep evolving. Often this is daunting, but it’s what makes it all worth it. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work?I’ve just finished Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers and just started reading Sapiens, but the actual reading I’m doing is Facebook’s Blueprint; it’s all around online advertising for Facebook. I’ve also started listening to podcasts, and am currently enjoying Reply All; it’s all about how the internet has changed how we live and how we’re affected by it. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit more about the telecommunications company you launched in the Middle East?It was the third company to enter Bahrain with two well-established incumbent companies to compete with. It was Saudi-owned and they tend to do things a little differently. It was still highly competitive – I suppose a lot like things are back here. We had a reasonably-sized agency and turnaround times were always tight, but we had fun and accomplished a lot in a short space of time. Today it seems to have sustained growth and is highly competitive within the market. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/415812-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Pendoring2017: Celebrating creativity only SA would understand" width="120" height="120">#Pendoring2017: Celebrating creativity only SA would understandThe 2017 Pendoring Awards are taking place tonight, Friday, 27 October 2017 at Vodaworld.
