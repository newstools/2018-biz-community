The individual pretends to be from a bank or other reputable company and gets you to disclose personal information such as your ID number, address, account number, username, login details, password and PIN. This information can also be used to gain unauthorised access to your banking account online.To be better prepared for spotting scams and ploys to trick you out of your hard-earned money be wise to the following, Fisher-French says.People lie for gain: Don’t believe everything you hear or read – especially on social media. Testimonials can be invented or paid for. Pictures can be taken next to helicopters or fancy cars – it doesn’t mean they are actually owned by the people posing.If you do not understand exactly how the scheme makes money, it’s because there is nothing to understand. Be alert to vague answers and if there is pressure to “buy now” walk away.Van Schalkwyak says: “If you have been careful and still become a victim of a scam, please report the experience to the South African Fraud Prevention Service.”
