Masego shares the same vision as Grid Worldwide, that is to build an agency model of the future. “My core task is the running of the business from a day-to-day point of view, ensuring that we are geared for building this into an agency like no other.”“The communications industry has changed over the years and continues to do so. There are players in the industry who are playing catch-up, and then there is Grid. They seem to have their finger on the pulse. There is something incredibly enticing about the work they do, and their energy as a team is awesome. I’m thrilled to be part of the magic.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428783-625x325.jpg?1" alt="#Newsmaker: Masego Motsogi on being part of the magic at Grid" width="625" height="325">We asked her more about her new role at Grid and what she loves most about her career and marketing communications in particular….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Congratulations on your appointment! How do you feel about being appointed MD at Grid?Thank you! I’m very excited. Over and above the incredible work they have done over the years, they really have an amazing team that brings the work to life.
