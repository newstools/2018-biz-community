The synergy between the two cities is remarkable, and this is the result of many years of relationship-building. Encouraging international tourism is essential, especially during this water crisis, since the contribution those visitors make to the economy allows for sustainability in employment and for infrastructural improvements to the city. We simply ask that all locals and visitors concentrate their efforts on saving water. We’re anticipating that this will introduce many New Yorkers to Cape Town as the Gateway to Africa, with all this wonderful continent has to offer.”Tourism in Cape Town contributed almost R15bn to the local economy as a result of the active work of almost 50,000 tourism employees (directly and indirectly) - according to the economic study conducted by Grant Thornton. “We are proud to kick off the second phase of our city-to-city tourism partnership with Cape Town – our first partnership with a city in Africa – with the launch of dynamic advertisements across both destinations. There are more reasons than ever to visit New York City, and we look forward to welcoming even more Capetonians in the months and years to come,” said Fred Dixon, president and CEO, NYC & Company Besides the two tourism organisations, the campaign is being run in partnership with Tsogo Sun, South African Airways and SA Tourism, further boosting marketing capacity.
