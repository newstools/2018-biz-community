According to reports, Geely has been pursuing cooperation with Daimler for some time now, specifically around autonomous driving and EVs.

Financial Times reports that chairman Li Shufu said: “In order to succeed and seize the technology highland, one has to have friends, partners and alliances.”AutoTrader CEO, George Mienie comments: “South Africans are loyal and traditional car buyers, favouring the German brands.
