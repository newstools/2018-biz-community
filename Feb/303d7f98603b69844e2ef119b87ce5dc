Once it’s cooked, add:- 3/4 teaspoon salt- 1/3 cup sugar- One teaspoon vanilla essence- Cinnamon (optional)• Four peeled and chopped apples or pears or oranges or peeled and cubed sweet potato• 1/2 cup sugar• 1 cup water, add a little more if needed (use ½ cup water with oranges)• Raisins (optional)Method1. Simmer the chopped fruit or potato with the sugar and water until soft. Stir to stop sticking and burning but only add water if you have to. Green apples are best as they keep their shape, but any apples will do, and the sweeter apples sometimes cook to a pulp, which is very nice. If you have raisins, add a handful of raisins to the water and fruit while cooking, for extra nutrition and sweetness. (Tip: If you have a packet of peanuts and raisins, pick the raisins out, rinse the salt off, and use these).2. Ladle meal into cups or mugs and top with an extra sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon, if you'd like. Add a spoon of hot cooked fruit before serving.Toni Brockhoven for HSI, Africa
