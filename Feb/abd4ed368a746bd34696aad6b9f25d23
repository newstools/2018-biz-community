"Today’s unemployment figures are a clear indication that the economy is still too weak to create jobs and the little economic growth that there is, can be attributed to higher productivity and the introduction of technology and mechanisation." Venter concluded by saying the UASA is looking forward to Cyril Ramaphosa’s New Deal where they will fight for more jobs, better jobs, prosperity and equality.
