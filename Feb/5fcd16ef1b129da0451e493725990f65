This insistence on meeting people on a human level has led us to develop and implement an online platform that allows us to interact with people wherever they might be in a way that suits them. No clipboards, no lab coats, no one way glass – just people interacting with each other to get to the real truth of the matter.The Greenhouse is not just a simple briefing tool; it’s a place where we can have real conversations about brands with people who care. This relaxed atmosphere where we treat people like humans and not just ‘respondents’ is what allows us to get to such deep insights. It’s the difference between stopping someone on the street with a clipboard in hand and asking them a bunch of multiple choice questions and having a catch up with a friend. It requires more input and a lot of careful attention, just like any good relationship does, but the results speak for themselves.We created the video below to highlight just a few of the amazing things we’ve learned using The Greenhouse. The next question to ask is: What things might we uncover for your brand?The IGI Greenhouse from Instant Grass International on Vimeo.
