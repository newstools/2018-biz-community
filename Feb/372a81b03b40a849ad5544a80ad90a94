Drop&Pick follows a key three-phased book, manage, and delivery process, which is based on a mobile application. The app enables any parcel shop to register a parcel, and the sender's details, followed by scanning the shipment and adding recipient name, delivery details and parcel size. It then calculates shipping fees. The parcel shop personnel can also book multiple parcels under one sender ID. In the back end - data entry processes convert images to actual data. The parcel is then handed over to the courier and electronic proof of transfer is collected, who then delivers to the end customer and once again, receives an electronic proof of delivery from the customer.
