The real Type R was outfitted with a custom-made mixed-reality windshield that broadcast the gamer’s position on the track to Rahal in real time, allowing him to compete in a head-to-head race against the gamer.R vs R is reportedly the first time augmented reality has been used to merge real motorsport with a racing simulation, creating a unique and innovative stage for the virtual world and the real world to battle it out once and for all.
