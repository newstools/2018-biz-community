Among the groups included Miss Earth South Africa, Operation SA, Tsogo Sun, South African Rugby Union, and the Muslim Judicial Council.During the launch, all partners echoed one another’s sentiments, saying that there was a need to make sure that Day Zero did not happen through their partnership and working together.They said it was time the citizens led the way in finding solutions to the water challenge that is facing the country. “The work of the initiative will not only be confined to the City of Cape Town as the most drought-stricken area, but will make its presence felt throughout the country in the face of the calamity that is quickly spreading to other provinces,” the department said.
