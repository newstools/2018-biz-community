These qualities enable women to participate meaningfully in our economy. Given the number of young women who are unemployed, and therefore vulnerable in every possible way, education is critical.”Holistic supportCell C partners with the Tomorrow Trust, a non-profit organisation that provides each bursary recipient with the necessary support in a holistic manner.Explains Van der Merwe: “Tomorrow Trust’s valuable contribution through psycho-social support, life-skill development and academic support has delivered astounding results.
