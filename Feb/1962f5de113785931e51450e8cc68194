Image © –Stock Sheiki on TwitterCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is often applauded for his inclusive policies and forward-thinking approach in a world of patriarchal bureaucracy and upheld as the ideal in the face of the Trumps of the world.But it was Trudeau’s turn under the Twitter firing line as a 'fake feminist' when he interrupted a woman asking a question at a town hall event in Edmonton, Canada last Friday and suggested:We like to say ‘peoplekind,’ not necessarily ‘mankind,’ because it’s more inclusive.Canada’s Global News reports that Piers Morgan himself, who made headlines for announcing he's leaving Good Morning Britain and heading State-side, just days after a TV interview with Trump in Davos - Trump's first international one, according to The Sun - sarcastically wrote about the #Peoplekind remark the following day, saying: “Mankind ended last night.”Then, deputy Tory leader Lisa Raitt urging the prime minister to “person up” in an exchange in the House of Commons.That’s all it took to catch on in the Twittersphere. Cue the combined internet’s mirth, outrage and witty words.Reaction went above and beyond this though, with some commenting on different tolerance for puns aimed at men and women.According to the Evening Standard, the comment was not taken lightly. Some thought he was "mansplaining," some felt he was serious and politically correct, while others came to Trudeau's defence saying the comment was taken out of context.Light-hearted sarcasm for the win, especially as Evening Standard reports gender equality has long been top of Trudeau’s list, having appointed a half-female cabinet – a step that has so far never taken place in countries such as the UK, the United States or Australia – he explained: "Because it's 2015." This resonated so strongly here in South Africa that we made it our ‘quote of the year’ for 2015.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1601/326366-120x120.png?2" alt="BoredPanda" width="120" height="120">[TrendTalk] 2015 was a hairy yearFrom manbuns to nutscaping, political meltdowns and economic downturns, The Donald Trump reality show, global terrorism and war, 2015 was a challenging year, to put it mildly...By Louise Marsland 12 Jan 2016Trudeau took note and apologised in Ottawa this Wednesday for what he dubbed as his ‘dumb joke’ that went viral and didn’t play well out of context.But the year is young, and all indications are that Trudeau will bounce back from this unscathed. For example, Trudeau spoke up on steps towards equality at Davos earlier this year, stating:#MeToo, #TimesUp, the Women’s March; these movements tell us that we need to have a critical discussion on women’s rights, equality and power dynamics of gender.He also regularly holds roundtables on the importance of diversity and equality and weaves the topics into the conversation:Paying the price for years of inequalityEvening Standard points out he vowed to finally put a woman on Canadian banknotes back in 2016, and when new banknotes go into circulation later this year, black civil rights activist Viola Desmond will appear on the Canadian $10 bill.Desmond challenged racial segregation in Canada as far back as 1946 when she refused to leave a ‘whites only’ area of the Roseland Theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. That’s what I call putting your money where your mouth is – literally.
