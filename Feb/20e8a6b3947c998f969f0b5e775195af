This is why it is so important that everyone, especially the poor, have timely access to high quality vaccines,” said first author Angela Chang, who was a doctoral candidate at Harvard Chan School when the research was completed and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington.“This study explicitly points at how investing in vaccines in low- and middle-income countries can have a broad health and economic impact,” said Stéphane Verguet, assistant professor of global health. “Policy makers should look at targeted vaccine programmes as powerful mechanisms for improving health equity and reducing poverty.”
