Three million people move to cities every week, placing increasing strain on urban infrastructure and services. Many city dwellers live in slums or poor quality housing, and many put up with poor air quality and transport links,” says TC Chetty, RICS country manager for South Africa.Those entering the competition have been asked to propose solutions to issues affecting 24 global cities, including Durban, Lagos and Nairobi. With a prize of £50,000 for the global winner, entries will need to provide practical, innovative solutions to address some of these challenges.Focus on urbanisation, climate change, resource scarcitySays Chetty: “Forming part of RICS’ 150th anniversary celebrations and focusing on three key areas of urbanisation, climate change and resource scarcity, the competition enables us to demonstrate the importance of the built environment professions and its appeal to younger professionals and students, while making a real difference to tackling the challenges facing the world today. In addition to the prize money for the global winner, the best entries will also receive guidance and mentoring from RICS professionals in their regions.“So if you’re an imaginative, problem-solving young professional, startup or student involved in surveying, urban design, architecture or engineering, then we want you to share your transformative ideas for projects and policies that will solve some of the defining issues of our time. You are the guardians of the built environment, responsible for all facets of our ever-expanding and changing urban world.”Entrants in regard to Durban are asked to consider what cities like this can do to ensure they protect valuable natural environments as they continue to grow, while in Lagos entrants are asked to consider how cities such as this can build more affordable housing to keep pace with rapidly expanding populations. In Nairobi, entrants are asked to consider what cities like Nairobi can do to encourage the development of a low carbon economy.Judging processMore information is available at www.citiesforourfuture.com.
