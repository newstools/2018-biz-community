Abrahams is still appealing the matter - which goes to court on Wednesday next week.According to the Presidency, the only issue that had been appealed by the President of the Republic was whether or not the former President or his then Deputy should appoint the NDPP.  That matter is now moot. “At its hearing on Wednesday, 28 February 2018, the Constitutional Court will also be considering whether or not to confirm the High Court’s decision that some sections of the National Prosecuting Authority Act – those dealing with suspension of the NDPP - are unconstitutional,” the Presidency said. President Ramaphosa has indicated that he will no longer prosecute the appeal in this matter and will therefore not be present in court to argue the matter on 28 February.
