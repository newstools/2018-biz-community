TAU artistic director Candice Heyns says: “What sets TAU apart from any other venue in the entire country is our unique approach to music where only the best international and top local acts are our primary focus. Surrounded by upmarket decor, the best cocktail and other beverage services, and our international level of light installations, it will astound and mesmerise anyone. A word-of-mouth demand has already been created where we are inundated with a database of people who want to be part of the TAU community. And all are welcome, as long as they share the core values of respect and love for one another.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428748-625x417.jpg" alt="TAU opens in Cape Town" width="625" height="417">She adds that a no-attitude, sophisticated, and respectful service culture can be expected with smart and service-orientated hostesses. Friday club nights will include disco, house, tech house, deep tech and techno with either a top local or international act, while Saturday evenings will be enchanted with collaborated theme nights that will be one of a kind experience, week after week.“TAU provides a dance floor, including three bars, an upmarket lounge area; a smoking area in a courtyard; and is polished in its sophisticated roughness which reminds of a world-class industrial loft. Our imported sound system is world-class - you cannot get better sound anywhere else. But what is probably the most astounding is our motion sensor lights and other moving light installations, including a massive LED HD screen on the dancefloor, that seems to leave everyone in a hypnotic state of awe,” states Heyns.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428749-625x417.jpg" alt="TAU opens in Cape Town" width="625" height="417">Heyns herself is a famed DJ and event organiser, who toured Europe as both a DJ performer and assisted in arranging some of the most inspiring line-ups, events and festivals in her career.“Many Capetonians will recall the popular hotspot, Opium, whose reign ended with the building of the Cape Quarter. It’s fitting then that the team behind TAU is the same team that brought you Opium way back when; so you just know that between all of us, you are going to experience the ultimate night out on the town. We say this with confidence, not arrogance. We’ve invested months and months of planning to create TAU - the playground you didn’t even know you were dreaming about,” she says.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428751-625x417.jpg" alt="TAU opens in Cape Town" width="625" height="417">Co-owner Ian McMahon says, “The team sat around a table and brainstormed names. And as if it was just meant to be, the name TAU ('lion') popped up and was an immediate winner as it is a perfect fit in terms of the pride one finds in a pact as a family union, being like-minded and protective of one another, while remaining strong. And that’s what TAU is all about - a venue for a one-of-a-kind, respectful community. Even just the name TAU when pronounced brings across a sound of strength and pride - and that’s exactly what it’s all about.”For more on TAU and the latest news of upcoming events, join the conversation on Facebook (TAU Cape Town) and @taucpt on other social media platforms.
