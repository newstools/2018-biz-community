In addition to having discovered, signed and produced multi-platinum artists Ringo Madlingozi and Mango Groove, his soundtracks have featured on over 12,000 TV, cinema and radio commercials. Schroder himself features with Academy Award-winning actor Sir Ben Kingsley in the Santam TV/cinema commercials, gold Loerie-winning ‘Real McCoy’ and ‘Back at Ya’.Schroder and Shannon, known to be blessed with perfect pitch, went on to compose and produce the soundtrack for London’s winning bid for the 2012 Olympics:So Schroder is clearly a jack of all trades, having founded Robroy Music 35 years ago and also serving as composer and producer.He works on various music tracks and sound design for commercials for various clients, a number of which gained recognition at the most recent Loeries, such as ‘TV and cinema commercials - up to 90s’ campaign silver and a ‘TV crafts – best use of licensed music’ craft certificate on ‘Pa Rum Pum Pum Pum’ for Pick n Pay through King James II, which offers a humorous look at the flip-side of Christmas, with Ladysmith Black Mambazo singing the Robroy arrangement of ‘Little Drummer Boy’:The Cell C C-Surance 'iGugu' campaign - 'Lebo', 'Nomsa', 'Siya' by FCB Africa also picked up overall campaign craft for 'music and sound design', as well as craft certificates in direction and performance.Robroy has also worked on former Loeries’ Grand Prix-winners ‘Young, Gifted and Black’ by Ogilvy SA for Channel O and ‘Beautiful’ by King James for Allan Gray. As a result, Robroy Music was ranked as the third-best radio recording studio in the Loeries Ranking 2017, a new entrant to the ranking based on the radio communication category alone. Schroder himself also shone in joint-eighth position in the music and sound composition 2017 table.I caught up with Schroder to find out how they plan to extend their winning streak this year and who they admire most in the industry… .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you attribute this year’s successes to?
