Motus encompasses Imperial's vehicle import and distribution; vehicle retail and rental; aftermarket parts; and motor-related financial services operations.Decision to be made by JuneAccording to a report on Business Day Live, the group said the "key strategic question" was whether the long-term fortunes of its Imperial Logistics and Motus divisions would be boosted by separate listings. A decision would be made by June 2018. The report further states that, according to Imperial CEO Mark Lamberti, splitting Imperial Holdings, which employed about 49,000 people in 33 African and European countries, into logistics and vehicle sectors would be carried out on the JSE. But for Motus to grow, it would have to happen outside of South African markets, he said.The group posted double-digit growth in its first-half headline profit despite what it said was a competitive landscape. Headline earnings per share rose 16% to R7.17 in the six months to December. Group revenue was up 11% to a record R66.5bn and net profit rose 12% to R1.36bn.Motus, the larger division, grew revenue by 16% and operating profit rose 5%. The group said revenue and profit rose at all four subdivisions, thanks mainly to "competitive vehicle pricing and a strong improvement in entry-level and pre-owned vehicle sales in SA, where stable interest rates improved affordability".Imperial Logistics grew revenue by 5% and operating profit by 7%. Excluding businesses held for sale, revenue and operating profit increased by 7% and 5% respectively.Sources:Imperialâ€™s unbundling will depend on resultsImperial Holdings delves into unbundling plans, reports solid H1 resultsBDPro via I-Net Bridge
