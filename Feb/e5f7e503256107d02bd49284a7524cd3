GinaZ BnB is a new arrival on the guesthouse scene in Ballito and is sure to make waves when it opens in February 2018. Make no mistake, one is spoilt for choice when it comes to accommodation in the area and it certainly requires a gutsy and bold approach when opening up something new in this competitive environment. However, it is often said that it is the hosts who have the following and not the establishment. It couldn’t be better said in this case as Tony and Lize bring loads of knowledge, expertise, and finesse when it comes to personalised management and hosting of guests.<img src="/c/1802/429642-625x397.jpg" alt="GinaZ BnB: a new arrival in Ballito" width="625" height="397">Perfect for friends and familyGinaZ is perfectly located in the quiet residential hub of Ballito with views over the inviting Indian Ocean.
