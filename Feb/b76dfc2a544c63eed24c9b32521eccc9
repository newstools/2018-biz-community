They are ahead of their years in offering self-service check-in and technological add-ons that attract not only millennials but the traveller seeking convenience at an affordable price. They are a great addition to the Onomo portfolio and complement our current brand strategy,” says Cedric Guilleminot, Onomo CEO.  Regional operational director of South and East Africa, Samantha Annandale adds: “With so many international companies exiting Africa and investment leaving our shores, it is encouraging to see that our group has a fully focussed African strategy. We have exceptional confidence in Africa, especially in the hospitality space and with our strong development pipeline we aim to become one of the leading hotel chains in Africa, for Africa.”Signature Lux will now be known as Signature Lux by Onomo Hotels.
