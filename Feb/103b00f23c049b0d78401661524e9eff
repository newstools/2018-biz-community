The hotel’s planned facilities are geared to provide for a range of much-needed amenities in the city – additional conferencing venues, high-end food and beverage services, and a spa. Most exciting is the amphitheatre which will attract mega-events into the city.”  According to Mark O’Donnell, chairman of Union Gold Zambia: “We have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with Protea Hotels for the past 17 years, and look forward to the expansion of our association through the development of this new property. Zambia is a country with huge potential for both business and leisure tourism, yet it has for many years been under-serviced in the rollout of tourist infrastructure. Our new venture will meet the rising demand for quality lodging in the country.”BonanzaThe new hotel will be located within Bonanza Estate, a newly launched estate which is set amidst the scenic environs of an 18-hole golf course designed by world-renowned golf course designer Peter Matkovich. This is expected to attract major international golf tournaments and emerge as a key attraction for leisure travellers and golf enthusiasts.

Bonanza Estate is close to the international airport and to the Multi-Facility Economic Zone – an initiative of the Zambian and Japanese governments and is set to become the new emerging centre for business. Construction of the hotel is scheduled to commence towards the beginning of 2019 with a targeted opening two years later.
