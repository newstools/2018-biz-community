The 2017 harvest was even stronger with excellent returns to growers and the company is optimistic about the 2018 crop continuing the upward trend,” he says. Tru-Cape took the strategic decision to focus on the local rather than export market to give the company the full possible sales window over the festive season and not lose out while the fruit was on the sea. “In some cases, Tru-Cape achieved higher local-market prices for our quality product than other exporters did for their export crop as they were competing with other exported cherries,” Pienaar says.<img src="/c/1802/429333-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Couleur via" width="120" height="120">Cherries show export potential for the Western CapeOnce a very small-volume crop in the Western Cape, cherries have more than quadrupled their export market share over the last four years and continue to show excellent potential as an alternative crop...14 Feb 2018Ceres, in the Western Cape, is increasingly getting a bigger piece of the cherry pie as the Ceres climate of hot summer temperatures and cold winter nights, so desirable also for apple and pear production, is perfect for cherries. With harvest between mid-October and mid-November, the South African cherry season is a short one but, because of its proximity to the high-value Christmas season, this most traditional celebratory fruit delivers strong returns and Tru-Cape expects the 2018 crop to be no different.
