By comparison, Zero’s SR hits 60m/h in 3.3 seconds, and the Mission R racer has a top speed of more than 150mph (+-241km/h), with a sub-three-second sprint time."One might think the electric motorcycle industry is small and while that may be true, it is growing slowly but surely. In fact, market research firm TechNavio projected 45% growth in the electric motorcycle industry by 2020 in a 2016 report.For more:Harley-Davidson Is Making an Electric MotorcycleHarley-Davidson electric motorcycle confirmed for production within 18 monthsHarley-Davidson’s first production electric motorcycle will debut in 2019
