"Autonomous" ship technology, still in its infancyUnmanned or "autonomous" ship technology, still in its infancy, would allow both civilian and military craft to be remotely controlled. It could revolutionise the shipping industry by creating more cargo space on unmanned ships, which would also save huge sums in labour costs.As the first of its kind to be built in Asia, Zhuhai's "unmanned boat test site" is expected to become the world's largest with an area of" about 770 square kilometres.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/427310-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo by Ian Simmonds on Unsplash" width="120" height="120">The digital evolution of South Africa's shipping industryAs South Africa's maritime and shipping industry continues to benefit from technological interconnectivity, the sector is on the brink of a true digital evolution - but requires dynamic changes to be made to its policies...30 Jan 2018Islands in the test zone will be equipped with GPS, sonar, communication instruments or photoelectric components to guide ships and boats, according to  China's Science and Technology Daily. No commissioning date has been announced. "Beijing will use this test site to develop a series of new unmanned systems for military but also for civilian purposes, as this technology can potentially contribute to its economic development," said Collin Koh, specialist in regional naval affairs at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.Rise as a world maritime power"It symbolises its rise as a world maritime power and is meant to position it in the future market for unmanned ships, whether for civilian or military applications."Various unmanned ship projects already exist in the European Union and the United States. Norway is expected this year to launch the world's first wholly electrically-powered and autonomous freighter.China is trying to catch up in this field. It plans to launch at the end of the year its own autonomous vessel, the Jindouyun, for river transport and ferrying goods to islands.Source: AFP
