The Dietary Supplements market also increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% over the same period. Following global trends, growth within the South African market continues to be fuelled by higher levels of consumer awareness about well-being and preventative healthcare. There has also been a strong trend in terms of self-care and online purchasing. Furthermore, the increase in the prevalence of lifestyle diseases and the rise of the active lifestyle trend has significantly driven sales of Vitamins and Supplements. Immune-Boosting Supplements and Probiotics have gained massive popularity as boosting immunity and good digestive health remains high on the health ‘wish list’. However, the Vitamins and Supplements industry also faces several challenges that could hamper the strong growth being witnessed. For example, the tightening of regulatory requirements and legislation governing Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM’S) under which Vitamins and Dietary Supplements are classified continues to pose a significant challenge for the growth of the local Vitamins and Supplements market.
