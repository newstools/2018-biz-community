I own nothing in this photo. Except that gin company. @aviationgin A post shared by  Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) on Feb 21, 2018 at 6:00am PST "About a year ago, I tried Aviation for the first time. Since that day, I’ve spent my time finding some way to infiltrate the company," said Reynolds in an automated email message. “Aviation is the best tasting gin in the world. Once I tried it, I knew I wanted to get involved with the company in a big way.” According to a statement, Reynolds will play an active role in the day-to-day business of the brand and oversee creative direction. The details around how much of the company Reynolds acquired or its purchase price has yet to be disclosed.“If you think all gins taste the same, you’d be mistaken,” said Reynolds. “Aviation is in a completely different league and I couldn’t be prouder to be a part of the brand.” <img src="/c/1802/430732.jpg" alt="Ryan Reynolds purchases stake in Aviation Gin, now available in SA" width="600" height="397">South African launchFounded in Portland, Oregon and crafted in small batches by a unique bartender and distiller partnership, Aviation Gin is an American gin with a unique botanical mix that results in a much smoother, easier drinking flavour than typical London Dry gins.

It is an amazing drink with a great story. The first ever collaboration between ex-bartender and a distiller, Aviation Gin pays tribute to those golden times in America when gin-based cocktails were extremely popular. It is undeniably smooth and amazingly mixable and we’re really excited about its prospects in SA,” says Rowan Liebbrandt of Truman & Orange.
