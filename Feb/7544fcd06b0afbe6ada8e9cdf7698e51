Directed by Fort's Bongani Morgan, the new edition features a diverse group of contributors from various industries, including the likes of advertising heavyweights creative director and Starved Magazine founder and editor Annie Raman, senior copywriter and DJ Neo Makongoza, the beverage and FMCG industry's Vahith Baliram and Romy Townsend, business women and entrepreneurs Mimi Thabethe and Anelisa Mangcu, as well as special appearances from Trevor Stuurman and Donald Nxumalo. Here’s a sneak peek…And our interview with the makers: Auryn Hiscock, Fort’s senior copywriter and Fort Review editor, and Mikhaila Hunter, Fort’s marketing and communication manager….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was the main reason for launching Fort Review?Hiscock: Fort has always had a passion for thought leadership and places great value on being able to express and nurture creativity in its many forms. The time came for us in 2016 where we felt we had the opportunity to launch our own platform with Fort Review, allowing us to add a creative perspective to the business world at large. It has since evolved from Fort employees contributing to that of inviting clients to get involved..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the response to and/or success of the first edition.Hiscock: When we launched the first edition of Fort Review, we weren't entirely sure where we wanted to take it or how it would manifest in the future – only that we wanted to make an impact. Following the overwhelmingly positive response from our immediate network, we realised that we had a voice here that we could craft and nurture into something that could reach a larger audience. That first edition did a great job in laying the foundation and helping us realise Fort Review's potential. From that, we have made great strides by introducing the video series as well as having a more formalised event, and hope to someday have Fort Review as a widely popular industry event in its own right..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Fort's slogan is "Storytellers for a Connected World." Comment on video as a powerful medium for storytelling and sharing on social media.Hunter: We love the written format of Fort Review, and it will ultimately always be the starting point as we ask contributors to pen their thoughts. However, the film does allow us to push forward in the sense of being more relevant in today's digital age, and also allows us to get more personal with our contributors, and subsequently with the audience. On social media, it has been a very important step for us, as you can't post an entire written piece on the likes of Instagram which is by its very nature visually-driven. We are excited to see what the response will be like to the videos on social media.<img src="/c/1711/420921-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Newsmaker: Fort's Amr Singh on what makes a good director" width="120" height="120">#Newsmaker: Fort's Amr Singh on what makes a good directorFort agency's creative partner and director Amr Singh recently won the Craft Gold for Best Directing at the 2017 PromaxBDA Africa Awards for his work on DStv Africa's brand film in collaboration with Studio Zoo...By Jessica Tennant 29 Nov 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why did you decide to focus on video for the second edition?Hunter: It was a very natural progression for us. It felt like a logical next step for Fort Review, and having the in-house capabilities – along with being committed to producing our own content – made the transition into video second nature..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}And why the focus on Urban Culture, Women in Business and the Black Perspective in Advertising?Hiscock: The nature of Fort Review is that we do not as the brand or the editor dictate to the contributors what topics they write and/or speak about. The platform is a free expression of thought leadership – writing an article on a topic you feel passionate about, have a stance on or have something to say about. We do ask then that you are willing to express your opinion at our annual event, where we give contributors a chance to discuss their articles in a panel format.<img src="/c/1802/429640.jpg" alt="Fort Review launches second edition, a video series" width="625" height="300">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What have been some of the learnings since the first edition, and how have you applied these to the second?Hunter: I think the biggest learning was that we had an asset here with potential and that we could grow it into something the industry is interested in and wants to get involved in. Another thing that we learnt since the first edition is that people want their voice to be heard and that we can be that platform for healthy, interesting and lively discussion. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What can readers/viewers expect?Hiscock: Diverse topics, polarising discussion, differing opinions, and with the launch of the video series, beautifully-crafted and well thought-out pieces.The nine-part video series launches in February 2018. We've been incredibly lucky to have a round of deeply-insightful contributors lend their voices to the platform this year – something the series not only captures brilliantly but builds on in a highly-engaging format.The VIP launch event takes place this evening at Rockets' rooftop in Bryanston, and the series will be made available on Fort’s website and across its social media platforms in the coming months, so make sure to follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Instagram and/or YouTube to be notified as and when these are released.<img src="/c/1708/406593-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Loeries2017: Building the new creative economy at the speed of thought" width="120" height="120">Loeries2017: Building the new creative economy at the speed of thoughtAn interview with Fort CEO Shukri Toefy, where he shares insights into the changing value chain of the new creative economy...By Jessica Tennant 17 Aug 2017setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
