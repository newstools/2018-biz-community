People can find groups of people to speak to easier and faster. They can research information and form opinions more efficiently. Ultimately the internet gives people an opportunity to scale their platform easily, giving people the opportunity to influence more and sell more.Needless to say that as more people have taken advantage of this platform the more cluttered the Internet has become. Leading to people struggling to be seen amongst a sea of content created and shared by millions of people around the world. Social networks sued to be a great place to share your messages and while they are still effective, they lack the credibility that a personal brand needs to establish itself.

Whether you prefer a simple or elaborate approach it’s increasingly important to understand that there is more credibility in developing your own platform than leveraging someone else’s platform.Introduction to the worldYour platform becomes the place that introduces you to the world. It’s the place people can visit to know more about you, it’s more informative than social networks and does not limit you to their information displays.Your platform is a place on the internet where you can control how you come across. In almost every platform you don’t own, its very possible to be misunderstood, for something you say to be taken out of context, and for entities like fake news to influence how people perceive you or your industry. Owning your own platform gives you the ability to control your voice in a clearer, more detailed manner. It allows you to set the record straight, provide context and build an information base of your ideas and opinion.CredibilityInvesting in your platform shows people you’re taking yourself seriously and starts to build credibility around your brand. This credibility becomes important both for the internet powerhouses like Google and for your community of people who follow you.Google, uses your website as a place to attribute your credibility. It tracks people who link to your website, it analyses your content and ranks you among your competitors as more or less credible based on a host of factors.

Personal brand website and platforms become the source of information for you and your brand. Adding credibility to the messages you wish to share.Launch platformYour platform will attract a community around it. Over time this community will grow, especially if you commit to consistently generating content for this community.Once the community is established and they infer credibility to your personal brand, you would be able to use the platform to launch new ideas, products and services.
