So says Ricardo Rocha, Executive Creative Director of the creative consultancy Etiket, who recently received a silver Ingot at the Midas Awards in New York for their innovative FNB entry titled Harmonograph. The work was created to market the FNB Franchise Leadership Summit with the theme ‘Disruption’.<img src="/c/1802/430163-625x417.jpg" alt="Etiket takes silver at Midas Awards" width="625" height="417">“FNB has earned a reputation for winning local and global awards for its products, services and technologies. It is an honour for Etiket to add another award to their trophy cabinet with this silver Midas award,” Rocha enthuses.“This award is Etiket’s second international recognition and first Midas award, so it is a big feather in our caps and we are really proud of this achievement. The fact that we were awarded a silver in a category where McCann New York’s ‘Fearless Girl’, took the Grand Award for its winning entry promoted State Street Global Advisors’ SHE fund (an investment fund for companies with more women in leadership) boosted our self-confidence to enter more work in more categories in 2018.“The team working on FNB is still fairly young in terms of industry standards and experience, so it is really heart-warming to see young and passionate creatives getting recognition for good work! The international exposure the team received at a global awards show will benefit the bigger agency when it comes to local creative awards as well. You simply see things in a different light when your work has been compared to, and stood out among the work of the global agencies and creatives you admire.”The 2017 Midas Awards Executive Jury honoured the 2017 finalists with 1 Grand Midas Award, 52 Midas Gold Ingots, 88 Midas Silver Ingots and 102 Finalist Certificates from creatives submitted from 21 countries.
