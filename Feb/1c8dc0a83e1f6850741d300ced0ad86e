South Africa’s OOH advertising market will reach an estimated total value of R5.1bn by 2019, with DOOH generating approximately R1.7bn of this amount, according to PWC’s OOH upcoming predictions research. With the addition of a third digital site to the LOOP network this has grown Tractor’s portfolio significantly. “The new site is located in Somerset West. It targets Somerset Mall, Strand Beach, Strand Golf Club and the local area at large. Our development team is hard at work filtering through existing and new structures in order to further add to this network. We are extremely excited to see what the next few months are going to reveal,” says Ben Harris, rights and development director at Tractor Outdoor. The screen is on par with their current portfolio’s technology, offering advertisers tailor-made, real-time updates 24/7. For more information about the LOOP network contact Tractor Outdoor on 086 999 0226 or email info@tractoroutdoor.combRev('brev-9d294921-bea3-4bee-b2d9-fc73ab32ce8a', '>a/\<moc.roodtuorotcart@ofni>"moc.roodtuorotcart;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh a<').
