Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Routine sets you free! I wake between 4am and 6am (I never use an alarm clock, unless I'm catching a plane). Before the world gets up I try to accomplish three things: Get some knowledge by reading something, get some exercise (I have a morning routine) and get some focus (I choose my one thing I must do that day). I then take kids to their schools before getting to my school at about 9:30am. I then have back-to-back half-hour meetings until 12:30pm, at which time I try to have lunch with an interesting person every day. Then, more quick meetings and I try and get home by 3pm to do some actual work. Then I spend two hours producing something. This will be either a formal piece of work, like a presentation or a document, or if there isn't one pressing, I try and solve a long-term problem with some creative thinking. 7.

Three years ago I'd never even heard the word ‘pedagogy’, now I think it's hugely important.12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? When I'm pottering around, in either my vegetable garden or my music room, and almost always when I'm not trying to come up with ideas.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick?

What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?Only you control your life. Learn constantly and be proactive. The world comes to those who grab it by the horns.
