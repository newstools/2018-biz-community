These notes will cover all denominations – R10, R20, R50, R100 and R200” the bank said.In addition, the South African Mint, a subsidiary of the SARB, will issue a new R5 circulation coin to celebrate the event..“The existing Mandela series of banknotes as well as the existing R5 coin in circulation will remain legal tender and will continue to be issued. This means that the new commemorative banknotes and coin will circulate alongside the existing banknotes and coin,” said the central bank.The Sarb  expects the commemorative banknotes and coins to be introduced into circulation from 18 July, what would have been Mandela’s 100th birthday.The current banknotes in circulation that bear the former statesman's image were unveiled in his honour in 2012.“Nelson Mandela represented the best version of ourselves as South Africans. While preserving the value of money is our main mandate, our purpose is to be a bastion of institutional strength, contributing to a stable and prosperous economy that serves the well-being of all South Africans, and guided in part by Madiba’s values,” said Governor Lesetja Kganyago.
