Daniel Elombah denied that Elombah had anything to do with the article that police said prompted their arrest.Jeff Okoroafor, the founder and publisher of Opinion Nigeria, told CPJ in January that police requested the article be removed, but that he refused. He said no further action was taken.When CPJ called the headquarters of the Nigeria police in Abuja, the person who answered the phone said that he was not allowed to speak to journalists, and hung up.If found guilty, the brothers could each face up to 10 years in jail under the Cybercrime Act, Daniel Elombah told CPJ. At least four bloggers have been prosecuted under the Cybercrime Act since 2015, according to CPJ research.
