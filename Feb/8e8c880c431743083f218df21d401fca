Tumi Mdluli-Mhlongo, Editor of Essays Of Africa and CEO of Kwenta Media said, “As a small, but innovative publishing house, Kwenta Media thought long and hard about the soaring printing costs and decreased advertising revenue, this led to a call to rise to a higher level of excellence that would have an even higher reach.”What makes the digital app special? It is the sophisticated presentation of adverts, they can either come as still shots or in video format, which is customised to suite both our readers and advertising partners. The app also boasts some features that will give Essays Of Africa an edge over its competitors. It is very easy to navigate as it makes use of a scroll up/down option when reading a page, and a left to right swipe option to move to the next article. In addition to the activeness of adverts, the app gives you an option of clicking on the advert to be redirected to its websites for more information on the products on show. Inside the articles, all icons are wired to make it easy for you to be redirected to icon destinations such as social media platforms and iTunes.For the music pages, the app really takes it to the next level! It allows you to listen to the music while reading the review of the song and artist. If you do not wish to have the music playing in the background while you read, there is an option for you to mute the audio. Nunu Ntshingila, Regional Director of Facebook Africa says, “by 2020, more people will have mobile phones than running water or electricity at home. And for the first time in history, more people will be connected to the Internet than not.” Technology is developing at a rapid rate, and as more people get connected to the internet, less are spending time reading from actual hard copies of their favourite publications.  For digital citizens, time is money. We’ve realised that they need qualitative and insightful content on their smart screens at the touch of a button. Accessibility and affordability is quite imperative, and for the first time, African content will now traverse the continent to touch every #EssaysWoman heart in a split second. Africa, are you ready? “Every African woman has a story to tell. This powerful narrative will now be available 24/7. The horn of Africa can be raised and be more accessible to the world. As a publishing house we believe in African women, and in essence believe in ourselves. Thank you Team Kwenta Media, for your hard work and sleepless nights spent ensuring that we produce dynamic content and a unique, chic digital magazine. I love you,” Tumi concludes. The Essays Of Africa app is the future and the future is now.
