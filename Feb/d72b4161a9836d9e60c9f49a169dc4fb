Now in addition to hosting on Sundays, she will be on air between five and six in the morning, on weekdays.“Siobhan’s personality has a feel-good-vibe to it, which is exactly what our early morning audience is looking for. It is just the right amount of energy that is needed for the show that is the premiere precursor to our Breakfast Show,” says Algoa FM Operations Director, Alfie Jay.Momberg will take over as Algoa FM bids farewell to Shereez Govender, who took a personal decision to focus on her boutique business.This also frees up Saturday lunch, which will soon be hosted by a newcomer, Roch-Lè Bloem. “I’ve seen some of her work on local television and also caught snippets of her show on community radio. I have no doubt that our audience will quickly warm to this bright young woman,” says Jay. Roch-Lè is a Broadcast Journalism Honours Graduate, who also holds a degree in Media, Communications and Culture.Algoa Country can look forward to hearing her on-air “really soon,” says Jay.
