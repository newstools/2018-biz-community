It has a current network footprint of over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots across South Africa.   “One of our key objectives as a company is to inrease our Wi-Fi hotspot footprint rapidly over the next couple of years”, says Exmile CEO, Jan van der Nest. The company also revealed the completed development of its own social Wi-Fi and analytics software where Wi-Fi hotspot customers can use the software to directly engage consumers who have previously used their Wi-Fi service.
