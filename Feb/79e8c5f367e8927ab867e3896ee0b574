They know how to collect the right information, interpret it for their needs, and put it to good use. To enhance their strategic abilities and knowledge, these professionals don’t stick to the confines of their desks – they cross interdepartmental lines and get to know how other divisions like HR and finance function. They acknowledge that payroll cannot operate independently of other critical departments. Each business function intersects and is impacted by various stakeholders, their objectives and agendas. Together, they determine the company’s business direction. Payroll teams manage the largest cost within an organisation. To ensure strategic administration, it’s absolutely crucial that the payroll team has a comprehensive understanding of how the entire business works. <img src="/c/1801/424645.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2018: Mobile self-service and real-time analysis are big trends in payroll" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: Mobile self-service and real-time analysis are big trends in payrollMany of us are enjoying the benefits of access to the internet and connectivity from anywhere in our daily lives.

In today’s economy, competition is more intense than in previous generations, people work for much longer and rarely stay in the same job for the duration of their career.Payroll administrators need to continuously improve and update their skills, knowledge and abilities to stay relevant. This is particularly important in a global context that involves cross border legislative compliance. Given the amount of legislative changes that occur almost overnight in many African countries, this is far more challenging than meets the eye. Data protection laws are also getting stricter and far more onerous. The consequences for legislative non-compliance of any kind are not insubstantial. An experienced or non-responsive payroll administrator could cost a company hefty penalties and fines. To protect and encourage their global expansion plans, international businesses need to hire payroll professionals who are agile and can think on their feet. This, combined with an ability to think strategically and embrace new technologies, defines the next generation payroll administrator that will help lead multinational business success.
