Because of drought conditions, the route is dry and dusty.<img src="/c/1802/429827-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Mpumalanga 400 gets ready for Dullstroom" width="625" height="325">“There is nothing in the route that experienced crews haven’t seen before when Mpumalanga hosted events based in Lydenburg and Malalane,” said Roets. “It is an interesting course with a variety of terrain and should provide for an exciting challenge.” The race starts and finishes at the Village Green Cricket Oval with the first spectator vantage point less than two kilometres from the designated service park (DSP) on the outskirts of Dullstroom. Competitors then head towards Belfast along the R540 via Swartkoppies, Lakenvlei and Vlakplaats before heading back to base via excellent cross-country terrain. The route consists of a 170-kilometre loop which will be repeated twice during the race which starts at 8.30am on Saturday, 17 March 2018. The qualifying race to determine start positions for the main race will be run over a 45-kilometre route on Friday, 16 March 2018 and starts at 2pm.
