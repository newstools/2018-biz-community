Consequently, this increases the effects of these interventions across the extended school day (during and after existing school hours). Dr Allistair Witten, LIPEE course convenor, said: “In order to improve the quality and impact of these interventions it is imperative that high-quality innovative and collaborative partnerships between schools and organisations are led well and sustained to provide a system of support for schools.” The course is designed for Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and social enterprises working with schools across the extended school day, government officials and no-/low-fee school principals/management team members. It offers participants the opportunity to learn and engage with others from the educational sector in an innovative and open environment.The aim is to deepen the understanding of participants in key elements of systemic change at schools with a specific emphasis on collaboration and innovation to build coherent systems of support. Furthermore, participants will learn leadership skills in complex environments and key components of project management. “A critical mechanism to enable positive change is the building of strong networks of support around the education of children and young people. These networks comprise a range of actors across the public, private and civil society sectors joined in common purpose to enhance the quality and equity of schooling in South Africa,” Dr Witten concluded.For more information, visit: http://www.gsb.uct.ac.za/extended-education
