The result is a transparent dietary list of total fats, energy, carbs, sugar, fibre, cholesterol and sodium intake per meal serving. “Making good nutritional choices is a global issue,” says Robertson. “It is really important to insist that restaurants are able to provide consumers with information about exactly what they are ordering.” Multi-responsive and mobile firstOcean Basket briefed So Interactive on its vision for an informative, easy-to use, multi-responsive nutritional value platform, with a built-in calorie calculator and menu interface. Mansour and his team took up the challenge and delivered more than just nutrition; they brought user experience to the table. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/421406-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#NewCampaign: Ocean Basket's latest campaign is a fine expression of food art" width="120" height="120">#NewCampaign: Ocean Basket's latest campaign is a fine expression of food artOcean Basket's unique 'Mediterrasian' sushi offering is on dazzling display in the recently launched #TheArtOfFusion brand campaign...By Lauren Hartzenberg 4 Dec 2017The informative digital campaign successfully launched in September 2017, which saw customers logging onto the Nutriguide from their smartphone, and punching in their meal choices to instantly receive a live calorie tally and drop down nutritional value table. “The Nutriguide was developed with a mobile first interface, for an on-the-go, pocket-easy browser experience.
