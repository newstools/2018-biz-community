Techsys MD Andrew Walmsley believes the win can be attributed to the agency’s strong track record. “We’ve shown time and again how digital can unlock enormous value for the brands we’ve worked with,” Walmsley explains.  Pioneer Category Executive Erna George comments, “One of the critical capabilities Techsys will bring to top Pioneer brands Safari and Ceres, will be their ability to leverage digital CRM strategies to improve relationships with our consumers”.  Pioneer sees opportunities for synergy with Techsys, an agency that has demonstrated its prowess in the groceries and FMCG categories. No stranger to working with big, iconic brands, Techsys’ client portfolio includes The Foschini Group, Vital Health Foods and Burger King. Speaking on behalf of Techsys, Walmsley says, “We look forward to demonstrating how our culture of thought leadership can yield results for Pioneer Foods.”<img src="/c/1802/430846-625x165.jpg" alt="Digital pioneer: Techsys Digital appointed as Pioneer Foods digital and social agency" width="625" height="165">
