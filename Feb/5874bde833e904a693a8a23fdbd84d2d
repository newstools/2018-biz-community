We look forward to an intellectually engaging event that will entertain and challenge our creativity.”<img src="/c/1802/428003-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Time of the Writer 2017 participants, Image credit:" width="120" height="120">21st Time of the Writer International Festival taking place in MarchThe University of KwaZulu-Natal's Centre for Creative Arts (CCA), in partnership with eThekwini Municipality, will host the 21st Time of the Writer International Festival from 12 to 17 March 2018...5 Feb 2018Program and ticket salesThis 21st edition of Time of the Writer will consist of a day program that is hosted in four community libraries (Austerville, Westville, Chesterville Extension and Tongaat), art centres and schools around eThekwini where workshops and panel discussions will take place.

There was no such thing as African culture.’A very sad statement which to a great extent, even now, speaks the reality that is our education system in Africa. A new generation of scholars is on the rise, demanding recognition of the African intellect and its contribution to literature, an “African Renaissance” if you will. We cannot rewrite history, but we can question and maybe alter it. And most definitely, we will write the future. In the words of Kakwe Kasoma, it is time to correct this colonial hangover. As we celebrate Mandela’s centenary year, it is our hope that we can reflect fairly on this history and begin a new chapter as we own our stories and change the narrative.”Meeting established and upcoming writersFifteen writers will participate during Time of the Writer 2018:Award-winning creative author, Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀, from Nigeria;Experimental author, Jennipher M.
