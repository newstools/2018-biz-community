"South Africans did not take to the streets like our neighbours (in Zimbabwe) but instead took to their devices, as timelines were flooded with celebration.""The story drowned out Valentine's Day and many wished South Africa a happy Valentine's Day even though we are single," said ROi Africa managing director Tonya Khoury.Holding the top spot for close to three years, the #ZumaMustFall hashtag finally fell off social media on Wednesday night and was quickly replaced with #ZumaHasFallen, #ZumaResigns and #ZumaRecalled.#Zexit Zuma’s final moment before he leaves the podium.

The exit has been drawn out for so long that perhaps physically it's an anti-climax," Khoury said.Source: The Times via i-Net bridge.
