Direct to consumer is the way forward. Brands won’t survive with a purely B2C or wholesale approach, they’ll need to distinguish themselves in a unique way on what value they offer to their customer’s life. The rise of social media and peer to peer engagement allow customers to pick up instantly on any flaw they encounter. In summary, it will make us all have to work harder to meet the ever increasing customer demands day in, day out – learn from it in an agile way and ensure the customer connection through digital channels is prioritized at all times. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What industry trends do you predict for 2018?Predictive analytics to understand and predict customer behaviour.Tools to help optimize search, becoming more strategic on how to attract new customers and be surgical on where to spend paid acquisition budgets.Customised product offerings, content and messaging for each customer (segment).Platform innovations to allow for a two-way interaction with customers like our recently launched visual search tool, SpreeSnap.

It’s vital to ensure all teams are empowered, adaptive, and processes are agile enough to make modifications accordingly. In a nutshell: the Kaizen philosophy about nurturing change in little steps - at the right pace and time.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
