The jewellery line is available in Edgars stores and Mills went on to launch three boutique stores in the Mall of Africa, Clear Water Mall and Mall of the South - and a franchise network is in the pipeline. “I think it’s normal for people to be attracted to outwardly beautiful things, but crystals remind us that true beauty, strength and vitality all start from the inside, and then resonate outwards. I hope that my jewellery will remind women that although we can see beauty around us, we should also be able to feel and appreciate the beauty that is inside each one of us,” says Mills. Mills never let her lack of tertiary education or formal qualifications hold her back from being an entrepreneur whose business drive is balanced by her commitment to female empowerment and giving back to her community.  “Being an entrepreneur means you have to be resourceful with what you currently have – skills, drive, ambition, mentors, passion, attitude, faith and all that good stuff.  It’s about doing what you can, with what you have, where you are,” says Mills.Going abroadFrom a young age, Mills dreamed of making it in one of the toughest and biggest markets in the world - the United States.  “The US is the world’s largest market, and I wanted to test my capabilities and ideas against some of the most prolific entrepreneurs and business people in the world. In 2015, I went across to the US to exhibit the Crystal Creations brand and product range and test the market reception for our offering. It was an eye-opening and life-changing experience and I knew that if I wanted to make it in the US, I would need to focus there,” she says.<img src="/c/1802/429621.jpg" alt="Natalie Mills takes her Crystal Creations to the US" width="600" height="400">With the South African operations of Crystal Creations in the hands of a local team, Mills and her family moved to Texas in an effort to enter the competitive market.“The one thing that really surprised me about the US is how supportive the people are of each other – in business they take networking to a whole new level. I was expecting to have a tough time as a foreigner and that finding my feet would be difficult as an outsider. But it was exactly the opposite. I have been incredibly fortunate to meet dynamic business people who have encouraged and supported my ideas. The real breakthrough came when my brand and designs were identified by key US executives and brand experts as having international appeal.  "It was during the executive development meetings that I had in the US that my message and vision for the business was shared and encouraged by the most incredible fashion brand names. The next phase of my business dream was born, and the Crystal Creations brand I created in South Africa is now well on its way to being reinvented in the US market under my personal brand as Natalie Mills.”Crystal Creations is a South African homegrown brand, we are of international appeal and standards. I am so proud of the fact that we have made it to be showcased and featured amongst high profile jewellery brands internationally. Crystal Creations was created by a South African woman, in the South of Johannesburg, and I am exceptionally proud of my roots, and even more excited about where those roots will take me on a global stage.”
