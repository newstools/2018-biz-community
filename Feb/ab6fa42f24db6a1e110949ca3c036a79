<img src="/c/1802/429677-625x417.png" alt="How Lemok Agency is helping this shopping centre identify and fulfill less-obvious shopper needs" width="625" height="417">Many entrepreneurs, from the City of Tshwane, spend their time in neighbouring coffee shops and restaurants for the luxury of having a working space as well as access to free internet. This can be rather difficult places to hold meetings and Wi-Fi is usually limited. The Hub @ Sammy Marks will allow entrepreneurs and freelancers to use the space free of charge, without the added cost of paying rent or internet. Unlike the distractions of a home office or a public space, The Hub allows for maximum productivity.The core benefits of The Hub are chiefly the free three hours of uncapped Wi-Fi offered by Sammy Marks Square, and the high-class workspace that grants entrepreneurs and freelancers the ability to work comfortably without the pressure of long leases or the need to make purchases such as desks, chairs, printers, or lighting, therefore overhead costs are greatly reduced for these entrepreneurs and freelancers.“Working with the Lemok team on this concept has been an eye opening experience as we tend to not always understand the obvious basic needs of our customers. We are providing our customers with three hours uncapped Wi-Fi which is no longer seen as a luxury but a basic need. Absorbing the data costs comes at a hefty fee, but we are happy to offer this to all our valued shoppers," said Caley May, Sammy Marks marketing manager. The Hub @ Sammy Marks is set to launch on 1 March 2018, as an important part of revitalising Sammy Marks Square and the city. This is an investment of a necessary resource for the surrounding communities.“Our view is that shopping centres need to start reimagining and creating spaces to fulfil the less obvious customer needs. As an agency, we are relooking the roles shopping centres play in the lives of their customers by identifying the gaps that can be filled with customised experiences. The Hub @ Sammy Marks is a befitting example of this.”, says Lebogang Mokubela, award-winning entrepreneur and CEO of Lemok Digital Agency.With community development in mind, The Hub was intentionally designed by locally sourced talent - the custom pallet furniture is created by a local man from Mamelodi, together with the interior designer, who is a young talented lady by the name of Kelebogile Mabe, one of Lebogang Mokubela’s mentees, and also from Mamelodi.
