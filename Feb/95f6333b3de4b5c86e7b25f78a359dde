Attempting to bring its consumers closer to the brand, the irony of a chocolate brand hosting fitness classes isn't lost on Bar One. “As a company whose purpose is to enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future, Nestlé believes our brands can be brands with a purpose, with activities that can bring people together in a fun and active way so they can earn their treat,” states Zanele Mthethwa, Nestlé South Africa’s head of chocolate.Importantly, the initiative also presents those living in high-density, lower-LSM communities with encouragement and training to maintain healthy, active lifestyles at no cost.The gym squad's weekly locations:• Orlando Eco Park, Soweto• BBB (Tripple B) Bootcamp, P9 Bhenjani Road, Kwamashu, Durban• Aced Sports, Mamelodi Rethabile Sports Ground, Tsomo Street, Mamelodi• Ben Zwane’s Bootcamp, Dr Molemela Outdoor Playing Courts in Rocklands, Bloemfontein• Zola’s Aerobics Club, Ny49 Stadium, Gugulethu, Cape Town<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/428720.jpg" alt="Bar One Gym Squad gets Mzansi moving" width="600" height="400">  Bar One brand manager Malose Mabusela chats us through the aim and uptake of the marketing activity..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the Bar One Gym squad, and how does it work? Bar One Gym Squad is Nestlé Bar One’s experiential property that encourages communities across South Africa's various townships to enjoy free work out sessions. We know that chocolate is consumed as a treat, so Nestlé Bar One encourages consumers to earn their treat via the Gym Squads. How it works is you simply attend any of the current five gyms in Mzansi, register on our database and you are a member, free of charge..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When was the Bar One Gym Squad launched, and what sparked the idea? Bar One Gym Squads were launched in 2016 in Soweto. What sparked the idea was the opportunity Nestlé Bar One saw to launch an experiential property in townships to encourage consumers to lead an active lifestyle. We know the costs of working out can be high, especially for consumers in townships. We would like to alleviate that cost barrier through this initiative..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s the objective in terms of actual results?
