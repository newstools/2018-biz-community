Last month, he facilitated that the parties get back to negotiations, which eventually collapsed.The Deputy Minister said that the department understands the frustrations of stakeholders who called them to intervene, but “we could only do so if all the parties agreed to our intervention since this is a Labour disputed.“Valuable tuition time has already been lost, not to say anything of the adverse effects that strike action has on workers and their families. It is therefore in the best interest of all involved that the dispute is resolved without further delay,” Deputy Minister Manamela said.
