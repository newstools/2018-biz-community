The Brother Moves On, Age of Waves (fronted by the Joshua Grierson), isiXhosa vocalist Obie Mavuso and InviZAble are the first wave of local acts confirmed with more to follow.Garden State was born out of a dream to create a space that resonates with alternative creation. County and Schnehage have both worked in music and events (locally and abroad) for over a decade and are well aware of the need for platforms where audiences can discover pioneering, fresh and definitive acts: “We want to breathe life into a scene that has become mostly generic and we want to do it in a part of the country that's a perfect fit for our vision.”Official dates of the Garden Route based event will be announced on the day along with the environmental and social initiatives Garden State is undertaking in its surrounding communities. <img src="/c/1802/430197-625x352.jpg" alt="New festival Garden State launches in Cape Town" width="625" height="352">“In the wake of the recent disastrous wildfires in the region, our vision for Garden State is to integrate locals and tourists in support of the Garden Route's producers and businesses and to celebrate the natural beauty and resilience of an area which remains one of South Africa's wildest destinations. It is as dramatic and beautiful as ever and we want to encourage people to get out of the city and find their natural self with us - their curious, kind and free spirit.”Event details:Date: 7 April 2018Time: Doors open at 4pmVenue: Centre for the Book, 62 Queen Victoria Street, Cape TownTickets:Phase 1 Early bird tickets R390 - on sale now until midnight Thursday, 1 MarchPhase 2 Early Bird tickets R420 - on sale from Friday, 2 March – ends midnight Thursday, 15 MarchFinal Phase - General access tickets to be announcedVIP packages are on sale now – Limited (for the ultimate fan): Includes a mystery meet and greet with international acts and access to the VIP area at the show with complimentary welcome drink and canapés.Purchase tickets via NuticketsConnect with Garden State via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
