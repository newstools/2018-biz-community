Conducted at Spier winery, the study was promoted due to high levels of unemployment and food shortages on farms.Further studies focused on the irrigation of vineyards due to water shortages. Results from Dr Reckson Mulidziâ€™s research have found that treated winery wastewater with chemical oxygen demand (COD) of less than 1,000 mg/L can be used for cash crop production, as it had no detrimental effect on the crop as well as the environment. Cash crop production using treated winery wastewater will also come a long way in addressing poverty alleviation experienced by farm workers. It must, however, be emphasised that winery wastewater that is combined with sewerage wastewater is not suitable for cash crop production.
