The building blocks are there, the key element that is missing is pulling all of this together and leveraging it to build a technology hub that will incubate innovation and stimulate the development and growth of technology startups.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425347-120x120.jpg?2" alt="MyBroadband reveals MTN has best mobile network in SA" width="120" height="120">MyBroadband reveals MTN has best mobile network in SAMyBroadband has released its Q4 2017 Mobile Network Quality Report, which shows that MTN has the best network in South Africa...16 Jan 2018"The private sector is doing a lot of great things in silos. The starting point is to break these silos, identify key challenges that all parties can collectively work towards addressing, and unlock the potential that is inherent in this vibrant city,” said Kruger.Scarcity of venture capitalShe pointed out that the scarcity of venture capital is one of the factors that stifles innovation and the growth of tech startups in the province. In the last three years, about 75% of venture capital transactions were concluded in the Mother City, with Johannesburg accounting for only 20% of venture capital-type deals, according to statistics from the Southern African Venture Capital and Private Equity Association.“Gauteng is the financial capital of South Africa. We need to unlock resources in the province by creating an enabling environment that entices venture capitalists to invest in the ecosystem. This requires us to deepen collaboration between universities, the private and public sector. Universities are centres of knowledge that are renowned for nurturing innovation. We need to tap into this and unlock the potential they present,” said Kruger.
