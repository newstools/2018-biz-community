Our world has become more digitised and fractured, and brands are thinking more about how to optimise their sales in an omni-channel world,” said Steve Harding, Global CEO. “Geometry has evolved to meet these needs, and our new branding is a reflection of this evolution. It says we are a modern, omni-channel agency that focuses on the entire eco-system that exists around our clients’ brands - a diverse, curious, solutions driven company that is confident and ambitious for the future.” The new identity was created in-house by the Geometry team in Hamburg, Germany. It includes a new logo word mark and monogram, a vibrant new colour palette and a set of symbols that represents diverse disciplines and expertise coming together to solve problems. A new website will be launched in the coming months. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1802/429515.gif" alt="Geometry introduces new brand identity and logo" width="300" height="300">Global Chief Creative Officer Jon Hamm said, “This new look reflects our confidence and aims to capture the magic of the geometric world and bring to life the beauty inherent in it. We have moved away from the defined, rigid representation of our past to a more fluid, curved, organic identity that is representative of our exciting future.” Please email adri.dippenaar@geometry.combRev('brev-a7d73e9f-55df-497b-8751-f598e7179c17', '>a/\<moc.yrtemoeg@raaneppid.irda>"moc.yrtemoeg;46#&raaneppid.irda:otliam"=ferh a<') to request logo files.
