Consumer attention is scarce and a first impression can be the difference between being engaged with or ignored. In an ocean of online videos and photos, there simply isn’t room for mediocrity. Brands must use every media form to break through the ordinary and expected. Consumers buy with their eyes and are led by how brands make them feel. Captivating videos and professional photos cue quality and credibility. Research shows consumers are 64% more likely to purchase if they’ve seen a product video. Videos are pure engagement power Video is the most powerful engager in a brand’s arsenal. It ignites emotions, builds trust and doubles exposure time. Videos can easily explain complex concepts and is increasingly preferred over reading. Sharing product videos and how-to tutorials on social media will increase reach and support the sales process.
