By doing so, the governing bodies have endorsed the tradeshow as a gateway to the African market, and a key precipitant of development within in the hospitality industry.“Hostex is a legendary brand, and has become the go-to tradeshow for local and international buyers, suppliers, retailers and supporters of the South African hospitality industry,” says Darryl Erasmus, ‎chief quality assurance officer and chief experience officer at ‎South African Tourism. “It is with great pride that we announce our endorsement of Hostex powering Food & Hospitality Africa and IFEA, and look forward to nourishing the partnership for years to come.”F&HA Summary Video_01 from Orange Orbit Productions on Vimeo.South African Tourism aims to contribute to government objectives which involve inclusive economic growth, job creation, redistribution and transformation of the South African tourism industry. TGCSA is the only officially recognised quality assurance body for tourism products in South Africa. Chairperson of the NAA, Rosemarie van Staden commented on the size of the show on behalf of the Tourism Grading Council South Africa: “The sheer scale of this industry trade show speaks to the value it has brought and continues to bring to the industry. This show allows suppliers to connect with potential buyers, and vice versa, in a way which has contributed greatly to shaping the hospitality, retail and food service industries over the years. Without this pedestal, the hospitality industry we see today may have been a very different space.”Nick Sarnadas, event director at Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery, was thrilled that SAT and TGCSA had pledged their support for the show: “Having the support from South African Tourism and the Tourism Grading Council, again proves to us we are taking the correct initiatives as show organisers to ensure we are getting endorsement and support from relevant authorities and associations.”Hostex powering Food & Hospitality Africa and IFEA has been endorsed by every key industry association including RASA (Restaurant Association of South Africa), BABASA (Bed and Breakfast Association of South Africa) and FEDHASA (the national trade association for the hospitality industry). The show opens from 6 to 8 May 2018 at Gallagher Convention Centre, and online registration is free.
