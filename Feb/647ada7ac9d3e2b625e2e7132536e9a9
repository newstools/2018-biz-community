This weekend’s awards went to:Imfura - Berlinale Shorts - Silver Bear Jury Prize: Gisa, a young man, travels to the village of his mother, who disappeared in the genocide. He wants to comprehend, to remember, but is instead forced to choose a side in a fight over an inheritance, a shell of a house. Berlin’s programme says, “The film’s hybrid form, its fusion of documentary and staged material, gives it a great sense of immediacy.” Trailer: https://vimeo.com/255358801 Burkina Brandenburg Komplex - Berlin Short Film Nominee for the European Film Awards: Directed by German Ulu Braun, Burkina Brandenburg Komplex is set in a presumably African village, inhabited by Germans, and “describes a geographical construction that makes use of ‘our’ medial and collective image of Africa and puts it to the test”, according to Berlin’s programme.

Kenyan teen actor Gedion Wekesa Odour shines as one of the refugees and Variety called his performance “superb”; and The Hollywood Reporter praised him as a “find.” The Ecumenical Jury citation said Styx “discovers the biblical story of the Good Samaritan in the challenge the EU faces in the arrival of desperate immigrants from Africa. It is a film of high artistic quality, which tells a tale of suspense, and confronts us with the ethical dilemma that individuals and nations must face when we are asked, ‘Who is my neighbour?’” Excerpt: https://youtu.be/GEcqBhhiTcA<img src="/c/1802/431207-625x437.jpg" alt="Fortuna film." width="625" height="437">Fortuna film.Fortuna - Generation 14Plus, Youth Jury Crystal Bear and the International Jury Grand Prix: Directed by Switzerland’s Germinal Roaux, Fortuna is the story of a 14-year-old Ethiopian refugee (Kidist Siyum Beza) who has found shelter with Catholic friars in Switzerland. The International Jury praised its “sincere performances” and “sublime black and white cinematography”, adding, “This film transcends religious and political dogma in a beautifully realised tale of purity and survival as seen through the eyes of a strong-willed Ethiopian girl.”Supa Modo -  Generation 14Plus, Children’s Jury Special Mention: Directed by Kenyan Likarion Wainaina, Supa Modo is the story of a terminally-ill girl who dreams of being a superhero, and how her village helps her achieve that dream. The children’s jury citation praised the film as “touching” and “gripping,” adding that it “shows the resourcefulness of the girl and the humanity and the strong willpower of the entire village in their efforts to make the last months of her life something special.” It's produced by One Fine Day Films and Ginger Ink, the team behind Kati Kati, Nairobi Half Life, Something Necessary, Soul Boy, and Veve.
