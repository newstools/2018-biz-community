These are: Sabine Heckman – creative director FCB South Africa, Safaraaz Sindhi – creative group head Ogilvy Johannesburg South Africa, Tumi Sethebe – joint executive creative Director Havas Johannesburg South Africa, Alistair Morgan – creative director FCB Cape Town South Africa, and Dylan Davies – creative director FCB Cape Town South Africa. It’s worth noting that this list doesn’t even include the many talented South Africans whose creative work has taken them overseas and are now representing these respective countries. Another feather in our South African cap, chief creative officer of McCann Johannesburg Mick Blore will be sitting on the 2018 Executive Jury. Having South Africa so well represented on the respective juries is indeed a nod to the quality of advertising as a whole in our country. One can only imagine the responsibility and trust that is bestowed upon those who decide what separates the excellent from the good – the truly outstanding work from a body of incredible entrants. To give you a little background – the NYF Advertising Awards are a celebration, yes, but they are, more importantly, a recognition. A recognition of superior quality work of the most talented people and most talented teams in the industry. They are quite simply an honour for the best of the best. The festival is made up of 20 competitions boasting entrants from more than 80 countries, spanning a vast and inclusive category selection. The categories range from Activation/Engagement, Audio, Avant-Garde/Innovation, Branded Entertainment, Creative Marketing Effectiveness, Design, Digital, Direct and Collateral, Film Craft, Integrated Media Campaign, Media, Mobile, Outdoor/Out of Home, Package and Product Design, Print, Public and Media Relations, Public Service Announcements, Sports, and, lastly, Student. The work is judged initially by The Grand Jury – five members of which hail from South Africa – alongside 300+ other members spanning all corners of the world. The Grand Jury are the first to assess the applicants and narrow down the finalists through online evaluation. The finalists are then judged by the Executive Jury, aptly named the “Dream Team” – as these 34 members make up a unique and prestigious group of chief creative officers from the top agencies worldwide. This judging takes place over five days and at the end of it the judges will have recognised the third-, second- and first-place winners, the Grand Winners and, most especially, the one entry held as Best of Show. We at McCann Johannesburg are proud to recognise our very own Mick Blore, who is the only South African amongst his peers to sit on the 2018 Executive Jury of the NYF International Advertising Awards. Mick Blore is the chief creative officer of McCann Johannesburg. He has over 20 years in the industry, during which time he has not only earned personal recognition through his numerous awards, but has also worked for some of the world’s most recognised agencies. In the lead-up to the prestigious New York Festivals Advertising Awards, Executive Chairman McCann Africa Fraser Lamb says, “I’ve known Mick a long time and have witnessed a large part of his successful career. This is yet another accolade in his achievements and is richly deserved.”
