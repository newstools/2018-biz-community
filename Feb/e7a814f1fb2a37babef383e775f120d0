"Continuing with the bill in its current form runs contrary to the call by President Cyril Ramaphosa to all sectors to ignite the economy and create jobs," Mngadi said. "The Nedlac study recommends better ways of dealing with alcohol abuse in society without wiping out 1500 jobs."Source: Business Day
