In a statement released by the House of David Tlale, the new winner announcement follows several months of attempted communication between the SABC, producers Greyscale Productions and Tlale himself with the original winner, Kuena Moshoeshoe, who allegedly did not respond and, placing herself in breach of the contestant agreement, subsequently forfeited her prizes.<img src="/c/1802/428242-120x120.jpg?3" alt="David Tlale embroiled in reality show controversy" width="120" height="120">David Tlale embroiled in reality show controversyHe may be a gifted designer, but not everything about David Tlale is stylish...By Leonie Wagner 7 Feb 2018“The producers of the show and I have met and, after consulting with our legal teams, decided we had to bring this matter to a head. Even though we did everything in our power, we have yet to receive any formal response from Ms Moshoeshoe and we have decided to award Mr Moraba instead,” says Tlale.“Now I look forward to focusing on what this programme is really about, and that is to empower and work with the next generation of extraordinary young designers.”
