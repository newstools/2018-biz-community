This new approach is essential as the community strives to become more self-sufficient, empowered and achieve self-reliance. This initiative has been funded by the EU under a Climate Change Adaptation grant and the Finnish Embassy. The donors have provided tools and seed with the long-term goal of increasing permaculture activities, the productivity of gardens and fields and ultimately improving nutrition and food security. One of the limiting factors in the area, as in most parts of Namibia, is the water which has demands from humans, livestock and now increasingly large gardens.<img src="/c/1802/430278-625x858.jpg" alt="Image Supplied" width="625" height="858">Image SuppliedThe posters are highly pictorial as literacy is limited in the area and materials are produced in Afrikaans and English at the request of the community. They will go a long way to teaching the community the basics of this type of farming. It will also demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of approach to agricultural activities for the people in the conservancies.
