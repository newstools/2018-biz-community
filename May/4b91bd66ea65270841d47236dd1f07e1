And that is the need to be more sustainable.Yes, you’re thinking, you know it’s an issue; it has been since the 80s. Why worry now? One could argue that the problem hasn’t been irrelevant for four decades, but rather it has been growing. Even if you’re still in denial about climate change, you cannot argue with the fact that our planet has a finite number of resources, and our throw-away economy is using them up. Meanwhile by-products of waste and pollution are also creating a financial burden. Things need to change.

Justin Hawes, the MD of Scan Display and a co-founder of the EGF, says, “Meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions can be very resource-intense and wasteful, because of their temporary nature and need for quick turn-around times. Yet they are an effective marketing tool, and we should expect the number and scale of them to continue to grow. It’s vital we make sure they are sustainable.”The great news is that there is huge scope to do this, which the EGF’s one day conference will explore under the banner ‘Future-proofing your business’. Sessions will delve into topics such as: planning for a water-sensitive future (‘Never let a crisis go to waste’), hosting a carbon neutral event (‘Estimate – Prevent – Offset’), and the opportunities available to us in dealing with these challenges (‘What if Climate Change isn’t only a crisis? What if it’s the best chance we’re ever going to get to build a better world?).If you work in events – whether as an event or meeting planner in the public or private sector, at an exhibition or conference venue, or fall within the full range of event suppliers and sub-contractors – this is for you. Additionally, an EGF Master Class will run the day before the conference. The theme is ‘How to activate change in human behaviour to promote sustainable outcomes in your business’. It is relevant to the same audience and will impart knowledge that can help achieve many future-proofing goals.Event detailsThe EGF Conference: Date: Thursday 14 June 2018 Time: 8:00am to 5:00pm Venue: the forum white light in Lanseria, JohannesburgThe EGF Master Class: Date: Wednesday 13 June 2018 Time: 12:00pm to 5:00pm Venue: the forum white light in Lanseria, JohannesburgFor more information and to book your seat, go to http://www.eventgreening.co.za/egf-2018-conference/.
