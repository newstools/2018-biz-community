Funds raised will go towards building a new Waves for Change clubhouse in Harper, Liberia. In July, members of the public can get involved by visiting the GoFundMe platform on the Mami Wata website where they can buy unique Mami Wata products, such as the first Mami Wata X Missibaba custom surfboard bag, as well as African surf experiences. The proceeds from every purchase via the GoFundme platform will go towards the construction and operation of the clubhouse. Missibaba’s Chloe Townsend and Nick Dutton from Mami Wata let us in on how bananas they are, how the bag will help Waves for Change and potential future brand collaborations. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your partnership with Waves for Change and how you have been supporting this NPO thus far?Nick Dutton: Mami Wata and Waves for Change share the belief that the ocean heals and leaves you changed in mysterious ways.
