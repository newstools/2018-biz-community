Kantar Millward Brown’s most revered list celebrates South Africa’s favourite TV commercials and will focus on ads that were rated as best liked by the South African audience in 2017. “This audience is the local advertising industry’s most important critic,” says Nick Sarnadas, portfolio director at show organiser, Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery. “These are the people who ultimately choose to buy into your brand or not and so viewing and reviewing the Best Liked Ads is a useful exercise to participate in while at the show.”The Best Liked Ads list is based on Kantar Millward Brown’s proprietary advertising testing system, Adtrack, which evaluates the impact and likes of all new brand advertising in South Africa and, with a database of feedback gathered across the past 30 years, is the largest database of its kind in the world. In other huge Madex news, Cinemark will once again be running a sneak preview of the South African finalists in this year’s Cannes Young Lions Competition. For those who don’t know, The Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival is an annual global festival for those working in advertising and related fields. Earlier this year, Cinemark, as the official local representative for the Cannes Lions, announced that it would once again be sponsoring the Film category of the Young Lions in South Africa, and that it was searching for submissions from young professional teams working in creative communications, advertising and digital agencies. The seminar theatre is the place to be for this twice-daily preview – not to be missed! “We’re also pleased too announce that the Event Greening Forum will be launching its supplier database on 7 June at Madex this year,” Sarnadas adds.Please contact co.zabRev('brev-01e10354-1639-4c56-bf42-b6be9eadb1d7', '>a/\<az.oc>"gnineergtneve;46#&nnyl:otliam"=ferh a<') for more details on this breakfast session.For more information and to register for your attendance at Madex 2018, visit www.madex.co.za, or contact Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery on info@madex.co.zabRev('brev-a2ca6674-017f-486d-8f19-67b0c2681488', '>a/\<az.oc.xedam@ofni>"az.oc.xedam;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh a<').
