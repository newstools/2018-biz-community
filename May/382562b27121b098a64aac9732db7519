We were intrigued and excited when the agency suggested we use this practice to highlight the status of Debonairs Pizza’s new, praiseworthy, beef steak pizzas,” said Marketing Executive, Toni Joubert.“What better way to present a superior product in a fresh way than by using a uniquely South African insight,” added Cameron. “It’s Debonairs Pizzas’ most premium meat topping - praiseworthy as hell. An enthusiastic delivery guy who happens to be able to sing praises brought our idea to life in the most entertaining way."Debonairs Pizza Beef Almighty ‘Praise Singer’ was directed by Zwelethu Radebe and Ian Difford, from Egg Films and Hungry Films respectively with post-production by Fuel Content. The ad took just one day to shoot, and the 30-second launch version will be followed by a 20-second cut-down. The 30-second commercial currently flighting on SABC, eTV and select DSTV channels.Credits:Client: Famous BrandsBrand: Debonairs Pizza Beef AlmightyMarketing Executive: Toni JoubertMarketing Manager: Monica SitholeCreative agency: FCB Joburg                Business Unit Director: Mogani NaidooAccount Director: Kefilwe KhandaAccount Executive: Kaylyn NaickerChief Creative Officer: Ahmed Tilly         Creative Director: Greg Cameron  Copywriter: Anthea Weber Copywriter: Vusi Khoza Art Director: Gina Anderson King           Strategic planner: Sandiselwe Gamede and Katherine Anousakis TV production: Linda Hauser                              Media planners: Jedd Cokayne and Sulize Janse Van Vuuren - The Media Shop               Production companies: Egg Films and Hungry Films                  Directors: Zwelethu Radebe; Ian Difford             Editor: Tessa Ford and Fuel Content                                          Post-production: Fuel Content
