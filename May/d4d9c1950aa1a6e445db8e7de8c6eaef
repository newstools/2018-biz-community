Now it's different and even though there are still challenges, young women coming into the industry have more of an advantage than they did in previous years. However, women still suffer from the “confidence gap.” An interesting observation from Armour was that men apply for positions if they believe they have 60% of the competencies, while a woman will only if she feels she has 100%. Shah still never felt never quite ready to sit at the table. She said that after many years as a creative director, David Droga, wanted to promote her but her response was “I’m not ready.” She says, “I held myself back.” I felt a lack of confidence and self-deprecation.

Agencies are tough places. We need to give people a chance. We must get better and give younger women a chance. The one single thing we can to do is having someone you trust to talk to. Have allies and support system in and out the agencies. Shah says we must support female creatives: "Every phase in a creative's life is different. It's important to get into the details of what they want to learn and how you can help, whether it's by skill-sharing, mentorship, or being their go-to."
