When it comes to a Sandton CBD location, this one just can't be beat.Printed on Contra Vision with impressive dimensions of 30m (h) x 17.5m (w), this icon creates a full 525 square meter canvas for a blue-chip brand. And it's no surprise that one of the countries leading companies were first to grab this opportunity. MTN and their media agency OMD outmaneuvered a number of other big brands to take ownership of Sandton with this iconic structure.Guerrilla IMC’s Simon Allenberg was the man behind the deal, and his reaction when seeing the final product was as follows, “We’ve wanted to create something seriously impressive within the OOH Industry and especially in the Sandton CBD area, but this has taken it to the next level from both an impact and location point of view. 92 Rivonia Road is one of those prominent Mega Format sites that ended up being so much bigger and better once complete, it gives the whole of Sandton CBD a ‘New York’ Times Square feel and takes Guerrilla IMC down an exciting path for future developments... FYI, the next one is on the way!”MTN have first option on the renewal during the second half of 2018, but the Guerrilla’s are hard at work on a number of similar sites across SA.
