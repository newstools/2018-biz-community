To be placed third among the countries’ leading creative agencies is a testament to our successful evolution from a digital specialist into a fully integrated agency capable of becoming our clients' most important strategic and creative partner,” says Jason Xenopoulos, VML Chief Creative Officer, EMEA. VML South Africa’s ability to build what the agency calls "Connected Brands" has seen the creation of critically acclaimed work such as One Source for Absolut Vodka, See Money Differently for Nedbank, and Stop the Cycle for Huffington Post SA – work that has contributed to the agency taking home 36 local and eight international awards in the past year. “It is no longer enough for marketing to simply communicate a brand or product message. It must provide customers with something of value. At VML South Africa, we believe that the best way to achieve this is to create brand experiences that are compelling, useful, and entertaining. To give brands more than just a presence in culture... to give them a purpose in culture," adds Xenopoulos. "Judging by the 2018 interim Creative Circle Ranking results where VML is maintaining its third spot, we are on the right track.”
