I believe our client-centric, results-driven approach appeals to a wide range of clients who rightfully demand the best possible return on their marketing investment,” says Brand. Brand makes special mention of the agency’s integrated offering, which covers all aspects of campaign planning and execution, from creative development through to media. “We have strong digital capabilities, and also offer PR as well as traditional media planning, implementation and buying services in order to be able to offer clients a choice in 360° solutions or standalone specialist skills – depending on their unique requirements, budgets and priorities.” Brand explains that the 99c model is working well in Cape Town, and he is hopeful that clients in Johannesburg and Zambia will find it to be equally compelling, as the agency grows its footprint beyond the Cape. “Growth is incredibly energising to us. We are grateful to be afforded the opportunity and responsibility to work with amazing new brands in these exciting times. “New business brings employment opportunities and greater diversity to our client portfolio, which enriches our overall offering. We’re proud to add these new accounts to the 99c stable in our tenth year of business, and look forward to continuing to grow our agency group and services in 2018 and beyond.”
