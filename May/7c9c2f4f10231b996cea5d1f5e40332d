Diversity in filmWith diversity a core focus for the year, another highlight has been the expansion of CFF’s annual #DiversityDay to this year include the first-ever ‘Global Women of Color in Film Day’ on 16 May. Digital Journal  explains that the three-part annual global industry event is intended to focus on bridging the cultural and socio-economic gaps present at the Festival. The ultimate goal is to promote the work and presence of diverse filmmakers from across the globe, telling stories specific to age, gender, physical ability, race, religion and sexual orientation for global audiences at the Cannes Film Festival, as all films aren't chosen as Festival de Cannes official selections. Planned by Yolonda Brinkley, Beyond Borders: Diversity in Cannes creator has been running the event since 2010, and was inspired by “marginalised populations struggling to have their voices heard and their stories told.”  And so, the independent filmmaker movement promoting inclusion at the world's most prestigious film event was born.It's never been more relevant. especially “in response to the global cry of women screaming #TimesUp and #MeToo”, with additional support from the likes of Viola Davis' Juvee Productions. #CannesYouSeeUs?Now in its eighth year, Brinkley’s “Beyond Borders: Diversity in Cannes” or #DiversityDay has added the first ever “Global Women of Color in Film Day” at the Cannes Film Festival.Digital Journal explains that Brinkley showcased films by women of colour including Chris Beal, India McGee, Leah Patterson, Anna Carvalho, Meleisha Edwards, Gisela Savdie and Pin-jung Chen. In commemoration of this initiative, women of colour in film at Cannes and those who support them were encouraged to wear any combination of black, yellow or white with a yellow flower in their hair.Brinkley is quoted as stating that diversity in Cannes is committed to the fight for inclusion at the Cannes Film Festival and providing multiple platforms for underrepresented filmmakers to share their stories at the 71st Cannes Film Festival is their contribution to the cause. #CannesYouSeeUs?"A+ adds that Brinkley’s independent event comes at a time where “the ways we watch TV and movies have evolved, and it's time for the talent in front of and behind the camera to do the same.”Deadline adds that the Cannes Film Festival also signed “concrete, strong commitments” around diversity in partnering with a united positive action, initiated by the ‘50/50 By 2020’ collective and Time’s Up. This move comes after the Festival was berated for the lack of women among its lineup, with only three women directors out of 21 in the main competition this year and Spike Lee the first black filmmaker with a movie in Competition in the past four years. Variety adds that only one film directed by a woman has ever received the prestigious Palme d'Or award - Jane Campion in 1993 for The Piano. Last year, Sofia Coppola also became the first woman in more than 50 years to win the Best Director award. Meanwhile, Dazed Digital pointed out last year that not a single film by a black director has won the Palme d'Or or the Best Director prize at the festival. Ever. #TimesUp.The symbolic 82To show that the status quo needs a further shake-up, a symbolic “women’s march”  took place at the CFF on Saturday, with actress and competition jury president Cate Blanchett giving a #TimesUp reading.Deadline says that 82 women from the industry stopped halfway when on the red carpet as a symbolic gesture, to represent the 82 films directed by women and selected in Competition since the first ever edition of the festival.The Festival also introduced a harassment hotline this year, so it seems #TimesUp.
