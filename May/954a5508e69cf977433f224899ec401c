Close to four million girls aged between 10-19 years in South Africa miss a week of school every month and it’s affecting their education. The aim of Project Dignity is to reduce absenteeism and dropout rates in schools and increase opportunities for girls to complete their education by providing them with Subz Pads," says Sue Barnes, Director at Project Dignity. The Subz Pads are manufactured by Subz (Pty) and are distributed through Project Dignity. They have been producing these packs and distributing them to schoolgirls all over South Africa. “We feel very honoured in being part of such an uplifting initiative that gives back to the underprivileged. Sue and her team are doing an amazing job by changing these girls’ lives for the better, and one cannot forget that these girls play a vital role in the future of our economy and are the future of our country. The donation of just one pack could last a girl her entire high school career and allow her to not be embarrassed or worried so that she can attend school,” says Ben Harris, Rights and Development Director at Tractor Outdoor. Subz Pads are sustainable and could last a girl between three to five years. They also do not contain any gels or chemicals and are therefore allergy-free and eco-friendly.
