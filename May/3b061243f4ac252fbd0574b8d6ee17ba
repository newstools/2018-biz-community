John Saad, iflix MENA CEO commented: “Today is an important milestone for iflix and our business in MENA. Egypt is the nerve centre of culture and creativity in the region. We are thrilled to set up our new regional head office here and partner with Vodafone Egypt, the country’s leading telecommunication service providers to make our service available to tens of millions of customers across the country.” Now available to over one billion consumers throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa, iflix has established itself as the clear market leader in video streaming.
