Primedia Broadcasting is thrilled to have grown audiences to this size, saying that it validates many of the strategic decisions that have been made in the past two years. “We have conducted major annual market studies for the last two years, which have informed a lot of the changes that have been made on the stations,” said 947 station manager Ravi Naidoo. On the back of the market studies, regular Auditorium Music Tests (AMTs) and focus groups, the sound of both stations was refined to reflect our target audience’s needs. There were also some major line-up changes across the board on both station, including new drive time shows. Anele Mdoda and her Breakfast Club took over 947’s morning drive in April 2017, and 947’s rising stars, Greg & Lucky started on afternoon drive at the beginning of 2018. Kfm brought Darren Simpson, Sherlin Barends and Sibongile Mafu to breakfast and Carl Wastie took over ‘The Flash Drive’ on Kfm afternoons. In addition to the music and personalities, the stations undertook major brand positioning reviews, to clearly define the station’s value proposition to audiences and advertisers. This was then communicated through billboards, television commercials, and numerous activations, getting the stations out into the streets and communities which they serve. “Numbers are one of various metrics we use to measure success,” said Primedia Broadcasting CEO, Omar Essack. “What is also important to us is high levels of engagement and responsiveness, and these also indicate to us that we are on the right track. Some evidence of this is our sold-out events – we have consistently sold out Huawei KDay and Huawei Joburg Day with 947, and the upcoming Discovery 947 Rhythm Run is also sound out.” The full BRC RAM survey will be available from Wednesday at www.brcsa.org.za
