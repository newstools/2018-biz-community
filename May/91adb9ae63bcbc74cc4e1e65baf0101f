Only after we’ve given an overview of what's happening in the market where the advertising industry concerned do we go into looking specifically at how the One Show is doing, as the One Club for Creativity’s Creative Week is first and foremost where we have our annual international board of directors’ international board meeting.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/439624-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Kevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club for Creativity." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: Better representation across the boardAs The One Club for Creativity's Creative Week 2018 gets underway, I sit down with CEO Kevin Swanepoel for a catch-up on their developments over the past year...By Ann Nurock 8 May 2018While it does take some time to go through each country’s feedback, the brief is so clear that it goes faster than expected.Essentially, the entire board gets updates on where the body is, some of the major changes – it’s like an AGM as we discuss our finances, but most of the time is given to the international office bearers providing feedback on firstly, how One Club is doing in their particular region in terms of awards, and secondly, how One Club is doing in their region. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438789-120x120.jpg?2" alt="SJ Myeza." width="120" height="120">SA's SJ Myeza to serve on One Club's Young Guns 16 Jury!Cape Town's own Siphiwe SJ Myeza, director and partner at award-winning 7Films production company, has been selected to serve on The One Club for Creativity's Young Guns 16 competition jury...30 Apr 2018That’s in terms of all the development programmes through which One Club gives back to the international advertising community, including the creative boot camps, the Young Guns Awards and the Art Director’s Club (ADC) Awards..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}SA did really well at the One Show this year, with TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris walking away with 19 of those and the title of South African agency of the year. Comment on SA’s One Show wins. It was really encouraging to see how well South Africa did in The One Show this year. The last year was a very tough one for our clients and for agencies and for our economy, along with the closure of some agencies and the mergers of others. So it was no surprise that our number of entries was slightly down from the year before, but what was really encouraging was the fact that our finalists and winners were more this year, despite having fewer entries.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440046-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#OneShow2018: All the SA winners!" width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: All the SA winners!The One Club for Creativity's Creative Week 2018 has come to an end. Here's how SA scored at the award ceremonies held throughout the week...12 May 2018That was really encouraging, and to this end, I think a huge congratulations must go out to SA agency of the year, which is TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris, but also I’d be amiss if I didn't give a huge congratulations to Ogilvy and Mather for their two golds in radio!When looking at this year’s results, what’s also encouraging is that it’s extremely varied across the various categories.Radio is still strong, but we also made an impact in categories like PR, direct and design – basically, a really strong showing across the board, which goes to show that our industry is still alive and well and should carry on along that trajectory..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}List a few of the key trends that came up from the summits/workshop sessions and the current global state of creativity. The biggest one for me, which was shared by both advertisers and the marketers that I had the chance to interact with, was very much around just getting back to the idea – before technology, before media channels and everything else. In fact, the more unorthodox the thinking about ideas, the better the chance of disrupting today’s conversation.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/441813.jpg" alt="Dyeshana 'representing Wakanda' at the 2018 One Show Awards." width="625" height="672">Dyeshana 'representing Wakanda' at the 2018 One Show Awards.That was a huge trend that I saw, where marketers were starting to say that we really need to work on our ideas, and how we do them to scale, and in so doing we give not only our brand a voice in the ever-growing consumer conversation, but we also go beyond just selling product and we make our brands a part of culture.Technology still has a huge role, but more and more, if it's technology for technology’s sake, it's having less and less of an impact..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was your favourite winning One Show award-work this year, what made it stand out for you? My favourite winning work this year would have to be Burger King - The Home of the Whopper.It was an amazing way of ‘hackvertising’ in a way that was unexpected, in a way that was completely out of where you would expect the branding to exist and in a way that still had so much relevance and so much heart.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440869-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Fernando Machado, head of brand marketing of Burger King. © ." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: SA EXCLUSIVE with Burger King!In an exclusive interview, Ann Nurock talks to Fernando Machado, head of brand marketing for Burger King.

Describe the One Show 2018 experience in a nutshell. Creative Week has extremely inspired me, because what became very clear for me is that as South Africans, we have ideas and a unique point of view in the world.I think our next frontier is how do we take these ideas, and take advantage of the plethora of media – conventional and unconventional alike – that we have at our disposal, and make them blow up not just in South Africa but throughout the world.I'm really inspired to take that unorthodox approach to ideas, where we look at things from beyond siloed-media perspective, to create extraordinary pieces that have extraordinary impact.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1705/393788-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Images supplied." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2017: Reflections with Xolisa DyeshanaI chatted to SA's own Xolisa Dyeshana, CCO at Joe Public and member of the One Club's international board of directors, post-Creative Week for his One Show reflections...By Leigh Andrews 26 May 2017As are we!
