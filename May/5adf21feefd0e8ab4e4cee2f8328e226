She’s a supporter of diversity in all its forms and striving to balance out inequalities where they exist. As a result, it’s fitting that Credle’s appointment as chairperson has been called a ’natural selection’ due to her high engagement as a One Club board member, particularly in their education, inclusion and diversity and gender equality efforts – two dozen specific events are held annually.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/438981-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Susan Credle, FCB’s global CCO, is now chairwoman of the board of directors for The One Club." width="120" height="120">The One Club names FCB's Susan Credle chairwomanSusan Credle, FCB's global CCO, has been named chairwoman of the board of directors for The One Club for Creativity, as voted by club members and the current board...3 May 2018In sharing her favourite moments from One Club’s Creative Week 2018 overall, Credle elaborates on the need for the industry to celebrate passion projects as well as work done for clients.

Jose Molla, the chairman of The One Club for Creativity board of directors, announced I would be the incoming chairperson. I’m incredibly honoured to take on the role. I enjoyed attending the Wednesday-night One Show and celebrating outstanding colleagues. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/439964-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrabs from SA's top-performing campaigns on the first night of One Show 2018." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: First night results!The first of two award nights for One Show 2018 is done and dusted, having taken place at the Ziegfeld Ballroom earlier on Wednesday, 9 May, with Africa bringing home 1 silver, 4 bronze and 12 merit awards...10 May 2018On the Thursday, I participated in the Executive Leaders Session. It’s an outstanding day-long programme, now in its second year. What stands out most to me is the generosity and vulnerability that the attendees bring with them. Throughout the day, group leaders each ask a challenging question of the group, and the conversation that follows is full of helpful advice and observations, regardless of where we work. The question I posed to the group was titled: “Is your agency starting to look like a high school where the seniors never graduate?” We discussed the tension between autonomy and leadership. I learned so much, thanks to the positive energy and spirit in the room. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440196-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#OneShow2018: The power of creating your own female tribe" width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: The power of creating your own female tribeThree top creative directors, Amee Shah (Droga5), Justine Armour (72andSunny) and Laddie Peterson (Wieden + Kennedy New York) together with I-Hsien Sherwood (Ad Age) discuss, "The power of creating your tribe" at The One Club's Creative Summit...By Ann Nurock 11 May 2018I hope that, as leaders, we can use these experiences to create an industry in which honest, open conversations are both the expectation and the norm.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/442113.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: &amp;quot;Diversity and inclusion are the future of creativity&amp;quot; - Susan Credle" width="600" height="400" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/442115.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: &amp;quot;Diversity and inclusion are the future of creativity&amp;quot; - Susan Credle" width="600" height="400" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/442118.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: &amp;quot;Diversity and inclusion are the future of creativity&amp;quot; - Susan Credle" width="600" height="400" align="center">I also sat on a panel where we discussed Project Meddle, a case study entered into social on behalf of Russia.

The interesting thing about this year’s award winners is that there are no major trends. This is good news, because it means people are solving for real business problems and brand opportunities, instead of jumping on a trend. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/441818-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Dyeshana 'representing Wakanda' at the 2018 One Show Awards." width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: "Get inspired by an unorthodox approach to ideas" - Xolisa DyeshanaI caught up with Xolisa Dyeshana - CCO of Joe Public United and SA representative on the international board of the One Club for Creativity - while he was in transit at the airport, for his post-Creative Week One Show reflections this #AfricaMonth...By Leigh Andrews 2 days agoI believe this is because authenticity has been stressed over and over, the past few years, and thanks to social media, consumers are holding brands to that.Work that feels on-brand and that is meaningful makes us feel something, provides a service, fixes a problem or starts a conversation is being recognised not only by juries, but by the public. As a result, the creative that is being awarded is less precious and more powerful. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440203-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrabs of some of the night's big winners." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: Final night's results!The second of two award nights for One Show 2018 is done and dusted, having taken place at Cipriani Wall Street earlier on Friday, 11 May, with South Africa bringing home a further 2 golds, 4 silver, 7 bronze and 26 merit awards and TBWA\Hunt Lascaris named South African agency of the year...12 May 2018This year I have seen an emphasis on juries recognising famous work for big brands.

My favourite work this year is, “It’s a Tide Ad.” The Tide brand has been famous for stain stories for years. To go stainless strategically was a great twist, while remaining on-brand. I also think the idea respected the viewer’s intelligence. They didn’t dumb down this meta idea. People like to use their brains. They like to get the joke. And finally, to hijack all the other Super Bowl ads is a marketer’s dream and a competitor’s nightmare, and it proved that even with the most traditional media, you can still bring untraditional thinking. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How has attending Creative Week inspired you for the year ahead? Describe the One Show 2018 experience in a nutshell. Curating great work and celebrating that work with your peers is incredibly inspiring. It is important to remind ourselves of the bar we must continually set for ourselves. I genuinely believe that great creative ideas, brilliantly executed, will not only grow our industry but will also make the world better.  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1706/396004-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Susan Credle, CCO at FCB Global." width="120" height="120">“Show up and stop bashing yourself!” Industry reflections with Susan CredleI chatted to FCB Global's CCO Susan Credle post-One Show Creative Week about the creative industry in general as a preview for Cannes Lions 2017...By Leigh Andrews 9 Jun 2017As do we.
