By utilising Facebook's 360-degree technology, the manufacturing cycle of three industry sectors namely fashion, mobile communications and chocolate were revealed. “At Huffpost South Africa we tell stories and create experiences that matter, by shining light on truth and exposing absurdities and lies. So when the opportunity presented itself to partner with VML SA on this, we grabbed it with both hands. We are really proud what the 'Stop the Cycle' special report has achieved,” says Charlene Beukes, General Manager of Huffpost South Africa. Stop The Cycle, a truly purpose-driven campaign, has reached more than 600,000 people on social media and has struck a chord with the marketing industry at large having received more than 15 awards locally and abroad including Cannes, Creative Circle, Bookmarks and Loeries.  “D&AD and One Show are among the hardest in the world to win, so we are particularly happy to get some more of these statues for the office. It’s great to see that our winning work sits across categories, including Mobile and Branded Entertainment. This continues to prove out our ability to orchestrate creative ideas in a consumer-orientated, media-agnostic way... Doing great work in categories that are vital in connecting with South African audiences,” adds Ryan McManus, VML SA CCO.
