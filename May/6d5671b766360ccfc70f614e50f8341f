Madex 2018 aims to bring marketing matters to life. It is the ultimate marketing expo for anyone operating in spaces like digital and social media to advertising, PR, design and more. Madex has once again been co-located with Markex 2018, a premier promotional event that’s been running for 31 years. The two expos, which aim to provide a full-spectrum marketing trade expo, will run side-by-side as they did last year. SAFREA is excited to partner with Madex for the second year running. Robyn’s talk, titled “Freelancing is the future”, will take place at 11:40am on 6 June.With over 20 years’ experience across a wide range of marketing disciplines, Robyn is a freelance writer with a flair for strategic communications. She dispenses valuable insight and counsel, develops marketing communications strategies and plans, and creates content for an array of formats, including her own blog (girlwhogodtoldtowait.com). As part of her duties on the executive committee, Robyn is responsible for SAFREA’s Annual Media Industry & Rates Survey. “This is a fantastic opportunity for SAFREA to shine a spotlight on a communication space that is showing phenomenal growth,” says Meneesha Govender, executive chair of SAFREA. “More and more people in the marketing and communications sector are seeing that freelancing is indeed a viable and attractive option. This space is often ignored and under-valued,” she adds. “But we are aware that freelancers in our own organisation, as well as the larger market, are multi-talented, highly educated and skilled individuals. It is time for companies to take them seriously and see how they are going to be an integral part of future workspaces.” If you want to know more about freelancing and the future, don’t miss Robyn’s talk.
