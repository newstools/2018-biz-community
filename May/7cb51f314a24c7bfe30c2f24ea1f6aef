Now with our prime time shows being stable and doing very well, this season we decided to introduce the fresh talent in other time channels, some already recognisable names within the entertainment space, and some being more up and coming. We are confident that they will all add on a nice touch to our on-air offering and settle well within the team,” says Zondi.Tune in to Gagasi FM and also follow social media pages for more information in the build-up to the GagasI FM Red Star Experience.
