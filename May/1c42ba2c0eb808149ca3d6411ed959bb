In order to be truly effective, we’re asking that people encourage their family, friends and colleagues, as well as schools to take part and take a stand this Friday,” says East Coast Radio’s programming manager Zane Derbyshire.Aside from wearing orange to raise awareness around this scourge, Derbyshire adds, “We are calling on individuals and communities to also be more vigilant and become actively involved in helping the police put an end to gun violence by reporting unlicensed guns and criminal activity.”The reason people have been encouraged to wear orange specifically in order to make their voices heard is because it has become the defining colour of the gun violence prevention movement worldwide. It first started when in 2013 Hadiya Pendleton’s friends wore orange in her honour when she was shot and killed in Chicago at the age of 15.Take a stand this Friday and show everyone that you’ve had enough of gun violence by wearing orange. Also, share your pictures and videos of you and your family and friends wearing or displaying orange on social media this Friday, using the hashtag: #StandUpForSadia.
