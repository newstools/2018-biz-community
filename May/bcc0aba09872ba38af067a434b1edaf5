We’re celebrating our first anniversary by embarking on the second wave; we’ve learned a tremendous amount in our first year and we’re ready to go bigger and better. To celebrate, we’re introducing new talent onto the radio station.” She says the second wave is also about installing mechanisms that enable Massiv Metro to be more effective in communicating with its audience, and about being more effective as a business. “Massiv Metro is a movement – and so much more than just a radio station. We are radio that is relevant, that is for the people and about the people,” says Mangope, adding that Massiv Metro will be “the biggest radio station in South Africa” in the not too distant future. “Our commuters deserve a rewarding radio experience, our online listeners need to be included in our offering and, as importantly, our taxi drivers, who are our partner vendors, must be incorporated into the mix. That’s the strategy underpinning the fresh new shows in our line-up.” New shows were launched on 10 May and include Massiv Mix between 11 and 12. “We realised that this tends to be downtime for taxi drivers when they are washing their vehicles or chilling and we have created a show that will feature different genres of urban music every weekday with the hottest tunes in house, rap, R&B, maskandi, and much more.” From 12 to 3pm, a new show called Esbayeni features two powerful media personalities – DJ Mgedeza and Zola, together dubbed “two bulls in a kraal” – who Mangope says will deliver a strong force that will take over the radio and social media space. Football has become a prominent and popular element in Massiv Metro’s line-up and with a new show – Massiv 11 – from 6pm to 7pm six nights a week, it is set to get much bigger. “We are an authority on football and our new show is taking us to a whole new level. The show is hosted by Motshidisi Mohono, who has extensive experience as an anchor on SuperSport and sports overall. Our contributors are all big names in football, past players and analysts, and include Mark Fish, Jabu Mahlangu and Christophe Bongo.” Other new features in the line-up include different specialist shows each night of the week from 7pm to 9pm, and a Saturday Breakfast Show. “Saturday mornings are hectic for taxis as people go shopping, run errands, or go to work. It’s an exciting show to match the weekend vibe.” Adds Mangope, “Our focus remains on learning and on implementing our learnings to ensure a continued growth trajectory. Massiv Metro is ready to be a force to be reckoned with, not only in South Africa, but across the African continent.” Listeners can tune into Massiv Metro at www.massivmetro.com or download the app from the Google Play store (Android) and on the App Store (iOS).
