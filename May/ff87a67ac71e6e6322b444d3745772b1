First up is Melanie Campbell, head of marketing at Pernod Ricard SA...By Leigh Andrews 17 Jul 2017And although the business has been operating globally since 1975, operations in Africa only formally began in 2011, excluding South Africa, where our presence has been in existence since 1994.Africa has a young population and a growing labour force. This is a highly valuable asset in an ageing world. Furthermore, it is estimated that within the next 10 years, an additional 187-million Africans will live in cities – that’s the world’s fastest rate of urbanisation. So contrary to popular belief, Africa is on the rise and certainly the consumers we are paying attention to are too, as the rest of the world should.Our business strategy has chosen to focus on sustainable growth through a large portfolio of international brands, and a high-end strategy known as premiumisation. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1801/423963-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2018: Creating value remains key in the premium spirits brand experience" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: Creating value remains key in the premium spirits brand experienceIn challenging economic times, consumers either choose less expensive brands that allow them to buy more, or opt to buy less and trade up to indulge their tastes for aspirational brands...By Elizabeth Lee Ming 10 Jan 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Share a few insights into the African consumers you target and how they differ from your South African consumers specifically.Our African consumers have a huge sense of country/African pride.

Here's how Pernod Ricard has done so, while keeping sustainability top of mind...By Leigh Andrews 3 Oct 2016Consumers across the continent are a lot more alike than people may realise. It is on these similarities that we’re able to build on learnings from our South African, US and UK consumers, to tailor our approach to consumers on the rest of continent.As South Africans, I believe we could learn from consumers across the continent, especially the sense of pride and patriotism expressed through their everyday life such as dress, food, language, music and more.    @absolutsa One Source Live will be aired on @dstvza tonight at 21:30 on @1magictv channel 103. #BeAbsolut #OneSourceLive THIS IS A REVOLUTION.
