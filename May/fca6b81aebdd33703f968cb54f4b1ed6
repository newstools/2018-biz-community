The fund exists to offer short term assistance to members of the advertising and media industry who have fallen on hard times. With the exception of a few paid officials which include a treasurer and two social workers, all serve in an entirely voluntary capacity. While the fund is based in Johannesburg, regional branches administer local aspects of the ABF’s work in Durban. The organisation is in the process of re-establishing a presence in Cape Town.“We are currently recruiting fresh talent onto the Exco and are reviving several fund-raising and networking opportunities that will take place throughout the year,” says Olav. “The first event, a lawn bowls based fundraiser, has already taken place and we’re looking forward to hosting media agencies, creative agencies and marketers at future events. We encourage media and creative agencies to get involved and support an organisation that looks after our own community. It could be any one of us in need one day.”For more information on fundraisers contact ow@sparkmedia.co.zabRev('brev-2ae96f3b-a60b-4dea-a741-aec051760709', '>a/\<az.oc.aidemkraps@wo>"az.oc.aidemkraps;46#&wo:otliam"=ferh a<')Keep up to date with ABF news on Facebook, Twitter or www.abfsa.org.za
