In March, BPS announced that two high-profile transport-based end points were being added to the Location Bank network. BPS clients now have their location data pushed via API to Uber and Waze – arguably the two most popular transport apps in SA.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440635.png" alt="Waze and Uber join BPS's Location Bank" width="225" height="225"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440636.jpg" alt="Waze and Uber join BPS's Location Bank" width="225" height="225">For any brands looking to drive foot traffic, being a destination on these platforms is invaluable. Your locations will appear as the user plans their journey as app suggested destinations. Once your data is clean and ingested in ‘Location Bank’ it is synced out to to the world’s largest mapping and directory companies (Google Maps/My Business, Here, TomTom, Apple Maps, Foursquare, etc.) as well as a number of lesser known but very important local directories. Any brand with multiple real-world locations needs to be listed, and completely accurate, on a number of digital platforms that convert online traffic to foot traffic. Location Bank is the ideal tool to ensure your digital footprint matches your real-world footprint. To get your digital location footprint onto Waze and Uber get in touch with BPS today.
