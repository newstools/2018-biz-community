A few best practices when using LinkedInHave a strong headline – What you say upfront about yourself matters. It displays the characteristics of a professional and shows your credibility. Ensure that you have a title that is authentic and matches who you are and what you’re about in the professional sense of the word. Make sure that you have a current and professional image on your profile - There is nothing that screams out of sync with reality than an image that is dated and old school. In order to increase your influencing skills, you will need to show that you are current and hip to the here and now. Also ensure that your professional experience and any other courses of study are logged on your profile.  Upload some documents and portfolio files – You want people to know exactly what you are about right? Well that means that you have to populate your page with work that demonstrates your skills and capabilities and allow you to build your reputation as a leader. This will also help you immensely if you are conducting a LinkedIn job search. Many recruiters ask you to apply for a job using your profile as a digital CV. Include links to professional blogs and websites – Your LinkedIn professional platform is the perfect place to highlight your blog or professional website. Remember though that professional networking sites such as LinkedIn advocate and promote the sharing of good content. Make sure that your website has good content and some level of authority. Try to keep your pet interests, arts and crafts and other hobbies off this platform, which is unless of course your profile is a company page promoting such products and you are using LinkedIn for business.
