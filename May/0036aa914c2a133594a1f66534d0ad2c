“When you get a brief like this from a brand as big as this you know you have to deliver,” said Wilton Ackeer, Creative Director at 34°. “It’s one thing coming up with an idea for something new, exciting and unknown, but it’s altogether different when you’re coming up with the next TV ad for South Africa’s most iconic brandy.” It took a brave client to move away from the “four friends having a drink” formula. But Sipho Jiyane, Brand  Development Manager at Klipdrift, was very clear about why it made so much sense: “We needed to put the emotion back into our brand. The honest, genuine take on friendship - it’s what everyone has always loved about Klipdrift and it’s a real differentiator, especially in this category.”The ad was directed by Jason Fialkov of Carbon Films. He took on the task of ensuring the commercial looked nothing like the glitzy, perfect serve booze ads out there. The Gold Between Friends campaign continues rolling out across South Africa, but this new ad is most definitely the heartwarming highlight.
