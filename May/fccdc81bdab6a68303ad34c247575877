We were aware of how much people take sight for granted and it took us a while to come up with how we were going to execute this in a visual way, within the 48 hours. Our main focus was the simpler, the better, which in the end lead us to our execution..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think gives you a unique edge?As a team, we come in with two different perspectives and we work in a way that we can bring those two together and create a broader outlook.We are both still very young and new to the industry and therefore we are constantly absorbing and learning whatever we can and are eager to get our message across..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to?We’re both looking forward to being a part of the Cannes Lions Festival: getting that much closer to world-class advertising and the people that create it.

I look up to Dave Trott for his honest and refreshing commentary on the industry.Prince: A lot of elements that are mainly set at expressing the views of the youth, like how music is translated in visual pieces. Someone who influences me a lot would have to be Donald Glover because of how he tackles social commentary in his visual pieces.For more:Bizcommunity search: Cannes Lions content in BizGoogle news search: Cannes Lions on Google NewsTwitter search: Cannes Lions Twitter searchOfficial site: http://www.canneslions.com, Facebook, Twitter, InstagramMore info: Cannes Lions special sectionsetTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
