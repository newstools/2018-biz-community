The event brings together media advertising agencies, creating an opportunity for directors and other leaders in the space to connect and think about the current and future landscape of the industry.“We purposefully decided not to have a typical event where we would hash out more of the same industry topics,” explains Marise van der Lith, brand manager of Ads24. “Instead we decided to create something different that would add value on a personal and professional level.” As such, the event incorporates interactive sensory experiences and a great opportunity for like-minded individuals to network.Our hope is that the event lives up to its name – we quite literally want to offer ‘food for thought’ around the things that shape lives.Last year’s theme was focused on technology, its impact on the economy and the way in which it would shape the future, whereas this year the focus is on how current disruptive trends in international and domestic events could impact the South African landscape and why the industry needs to act now.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440608-625x325.jpg?3" alt="Professor Nick Binedell |" width="625" height="325">Professor Nick Binedell | Ads24.co.zaThis year’s speaker lineup features Professor Nick Binedell, economist Dawie Roodt and scenario planner and futurologist Clem Sunter. “We are excited about all our speakers.
