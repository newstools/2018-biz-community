They achieve this by applying real time systems and analysis which plug into both the company and the service provider’s billing engines, saving millions of rands in unmonitored and wasteful contract spend.Comments SeeClear’s CEO, Laura Coetzee: “The thing that attracted us most about a partnership with Pula/LRMG was their ability to really leverage our smaller company into much bigger prospects. We can now really engage much quicker and at a higher decision making level in companies – who we know really need our solution.”“As a small and entrepreneurial business we are also very excited about the mentorship and learning based programs that are available to us to foster our growth through being able to tap into the very experienced consulting base of LRMG’s people” Laura added.LRMG is a strongly performance oriented company itself: “as Performance Architects, adding to our portfolio a strong and innovative performance tool like SeeClear’s Intelligible™ web-based platform is very attractive for our clients,” says Ricky Robinson, CEO of LRMG.With this being LRMG’s third acquisition of 2018, following the addition of Game On Performance Solutions and BizWize Consulting to its group of companies in February, LRMG is positioned for substantial growth this year. Passionate about process and performance, LRMG walks the talk by basing its approach to performance optimisation on the very systems and techniques employed in its own organization.Pula seeks to invest in companies to which it can really add value, and ones that are synergistic with LRMG. Deals are structured in a highly flexible manner and strong performance criteria are included to ensure committed growth is achieved through the collaboration.Also read: Why BEE deals fail and is there a better way?And: It’s Game On for B-BBEE and Pula CapitalAnd: It’s a Wize move with Pula CapitalAbout LRMG LRMG aligns people and environments to optimal performance through a unique understanding of the connected mechanisms and contexts that drive positive people and organisational outcomes.
