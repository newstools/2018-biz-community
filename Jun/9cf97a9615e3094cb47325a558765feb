Every year we come to Cannes and we discover new things and new reasons why we should be part of this. It's more important for the industry than for Ster-Kinekor to be honest. It helps us keep abreast with what's happening in the world and on trend. It also gives us quite a unique opportunity to plough back into the South African market. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How have you found Cannes this year?It's been extremely hot outside – I don’t remember it ever being this hot, but a couple of things stood out for me:Humanity came through a lot and so did brand purpose.

The more customer-centric the companies or brands become, the more clear they are in their purpose.Gender-equality has been discussed for some time now and after listening to the UN Women’s talks on unstereotyping (www.unstereotypealliance.org), it is a beautiful way of saying: don’t put people into boxes based on age, gender, religion, etc. So, I believe Cannes is becoming more responsible. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/445131-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The first ever #MoreLikeMe Cannes Lions attendees." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Why you'll see #MoreLikeMe from #CannesLions2018Diversity is good for business, especially creative business, so little wonder that diversity is an increasingly hot topic at Cannes.
