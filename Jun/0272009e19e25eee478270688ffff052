Surprising when you consider that nonconscious processes can influence up to 90% of all behaviour and decisions,” says Wierzbicki. “Columinate has developed a methodology that adequately and accurately measures nonconscious associations, attitudes, and perceptions, which scales quite effortlessly.” Columinate’s nonconscious insights gathering solution is called Boost+; an implicit reaction time testing approach that, with its flexibility, can be adapted to address numerous objectives from measuring brand associations, responses to campaigns, packaging designs and so much more. Over the last two years, the Boost+ methodology has been rigorously tested and validated, and can be applied to virtually anything. “If you can put a concept into words, we can test it!” says Wierzbicki.
