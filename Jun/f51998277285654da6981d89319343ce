Where do you live, work and play?I Iive in Johannesburg and I work and play on stages around South Africa and, as of late, the world. I’m originally from Hankey in the Eastern Cape.2. What’s your claim to fame?I'm a relatable comedian. I talk about day-to-day life and say the things you are thinking and wouldn't dare say in company. It's what my audience knows me for.3. Describe your career so far.It's been a dream come true. I never thought this would be a career, and now it is. I have grown in this industry and I have toured the country and now I tour the world. I have been very fortunate to find my true calling.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things.I love doing stand-up. It started as a hobby and it’s now my career.I was a marketing manager at a multinational, with a BCom degree hanging on the office wall, doing this for fun, and I got really lucky that I can make a living from it now.That's because I would and still sometimes do this for free. I love comedy and ice-cream, lots of ice cream.5. What do you love about your industry?I love the challenging nature of our business. It's tough, even if you’re a great act.The fact is, funny is funny and no one can deny that.It's an industry that for the most part, to a certain degree, rewards your ability.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists.There is no average day. I have weeks where all I do is corporate gigs and briefings, and I have weeks where I get up at 9am, have coffee and write new material. One thing is consistent: I'm constantly looking to improve my craft, so you’ll find me on stage at a gig at least three times a week, trying material or performing around Johannesburg.7. What are the tools of your trade?A sharp mind. You need to be funny and have some business savvy to make it work in this business. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry?There are a few:I think my friends at Goliath and Goliath do a great job, especially on the business-end of comedy. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/406108-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#Loeries2017: The Business of Comedy" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2017: The Business of ComedyAn interview with Donovan Goliath, founder of entertainment company Goliath and Goliath and two years running Loeries Creative Voice, on running a creative business and turning comedic ideas into monetary gains...By Jessica Tennant 17 Aug 2017I think John Vlismas has and continues to be exceptional, from his performances to his sharp business acumen. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438753-120x120.jpg?2" alt="John Vlismas spends his time between worlds – his own and the one he shares with everyone else." width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

List a few pain points the industry can improve on.Well, we could be more professional.I think many acts rely only on being funny, and don't realise that this is a business like any other. Just because we make jokes doesn't mean we should take our craft less seriously then an accountant or a doctor.Arrive on time, perform to the best of your ability and be easy to work with. The greats get that right.10. What are you working on right now?I'm preparing my one-man show ‘Dating Life’ for the stage. It's my debut one-man show and it's been a long-term goal, so I'm putting all my energy into it. It's very exciting and I'm shooting it for TV!     10 Days until opening night.
