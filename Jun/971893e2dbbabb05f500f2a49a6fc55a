“As the market leader in flavoured beers, Flying Fish aims to get young adults to challenge the conventional and has started to earn its place as a favourite choice in the minds of its consumers. Building real meaning into the brand to drive long term equity with the right creative partner will be key to take the brand to the next level,” says Colleen Duvenage, Flying Fish Marketing Manager. The agency was also appointed to work on SAB’s newest non-alcoholic beer Castle Free launched in mid-November 2017. The new brand – especially formulated to meet the palettes of South Africans – not only offers beverage fans a familiar local taste, but also caters to a target market that does not want to purchase expensive international non-alcoholic beers. To activate the brand to the South African public, the brand and communication group will execute integrated work for the account, with Joe Public (ATL), Joe Public Connect (Digital), Joe Public Engage (PR) and Joe Public Ignite (Activations) included on the account. “It was Joe Public United’s strategic thinking, creative solutions as well as their shared understanding of our brand’s longer-term strategic business vision that made them our agency of choice. We look forward to growing with the team,” adds Tania Cloete, Castle Free Marketing Manager. “We are honoured and proud to be working on the newly acquired SAB brands. Our work and relationship with the Redd’s, Castle Milk Stout and Brutal Fruit accounts, have helped us to build a strong and successful relationship with the client which has ultimately allowed for continued and excellent growth with the client team,” concludes Khuthala Gala Holten, Deputy Managing Director, Joe Public.
