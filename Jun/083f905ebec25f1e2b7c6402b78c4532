A glance at the posts and shares on her Twitter feed and it’s obvious that sports broadcasting isn’t just her day job, it’s her passion. For example, this pinned tweet: Louw explains that she grew up in a sports-loving family and did all she could to understand and appreciate the pure determination it takes to be a professional athlete. That includes her own fitness regime of running, playing tennis, boxing, yoga, Pilates, high-intensity interval training or HIIT and also volunteering to assist at sporting events, as anything from a water bearer to a directions control officer.Here, she explains that passion for sports as well as the study and early career choices that led to her current role as sports broadcaster, what it takes to stand out as a female in the sport and broadcast industry alike, and how she attains work-life balance between also MCing events like Woordfees, the MFM 92.6 Awards, Maties Rugby Awards, and the University of Stellenbosch Sports Awards….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Talk us through the study and early career choices that led to your current role as sports broadcaster. In high school, there comes a time when you have to decide what to study, and my dream was always to be the Springboks’ physiotherapist. I realised this dream in grade nine while I was watching the 2007 Rugby World Cup. I saw this woman running onto the field and helping a player who was clearly in pain. I thought “Wow, how cool is it that she gets to be part of the team like that?” I didn’t know that a woman could even step into this male-dominated environment back then.

Had so much fun with like minded people. #falke #falkesocks #fun A post shared by  Cato Louw (@catolouw) on Jan 17, 2018 at 12:56am PST Studying physiotherapy – or in my case, a BSc in Sport Science – was obviously a step in the right direction. However, life happened and I switched over to a two-year diploma in fitness and nutrition at the Exercise Teachers’ Academy (ETA), and auditioned for the SuperSport Lady Rugga talent search in 2011 – while I didn’t make the cut to finals, the judges suggested I gain experience as a sports presenter by joining MFM 92.6, the campus radio station at Stellenbosch University.  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/444752-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Barron Hufkie by Eben Photography." width="120" height="120">#YouthMonth: How to make your mark in the SA broadcast industryThis year, Barron Hufkie is celebrating seven years in radio.

A post shared by  Cato Louw (@catolouw) on Feb 13, 2018 at 11:42am PST I fell even more in love with sports broadcasting on establishing and presenting my own show, ‘The Half Time Show with Cato Louw,’ and also hosted the Pink Couch live from Varsity Cup rugby matches hosted at the University of Stellenbosch. I loved sharing these amazing stories, shedding light on what sport is doing to change lives and of course, showcasing our brilliant talent in this country.I learned as much as I possibly could about the industry from my five years at MFM, and in that time I was lucky enough to start shadowing at EWN Sport.Thereafter, they offered me a job as weekend sports anchor for KFM 94.5, and last year I joined Cape Talk’s Drive Show with John Maytham. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1710/415535-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Images supplied." width="120" height="120">Cocreating the CapeTalk conversation in the digital decadeWith the rise of social media, there's a deluge of that 'breaking news' information to sift through.

Firstly, in the sporting community – know your stuff! I’ve always said: “I don’t just want to talk the talk, I want to walk the walk.” That’s why I studied sport in all its spheres; I wanted to know all aspects of it. I believe that helps, although there are and always will be doubters, but as women, we can handle whatever is thrown at us.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/407833-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nicolaides, Mortlock and Lindeque in action." width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: Inside the truth of the female-strong EWN newsroomYour worst nightmares often form the harsh realities of daily work life for the females in Primedia Broadcasting's EWN newsroom. While they spend their days telling other people's tales, I got them to share a few of their own...By Leigh Andrews 28 Aug 2017In broadcasting – be proactive. You sometimes get stuck in a role because you’re a woman or have a certain personality, but that’s not necessarily where you want to end up. Unfortunately, we all have to do jobs we don’t always like – that’s all part of finding out what you do actually like. So, go find an opportunity. If there’s a role you want to step into, ask!     Yesterday I was part of a very special all female #Squad with @andy_maqo, @zbzoebrown & @nataliemalgas on the #TheFlashDrive. I obviously thought everyone else was also pulling a face�� #kfm #futureisfemale A post shared by  Cato Louw (@catolouw) on Jun 27, 2018 at 1:07am PDT Apply your passion and the doors will open for you. As an example, I asked to shadow at EWN Sport while working at MFM. I emailed the editor and he said I could shadow him for a few days. I wanted to make sure MFM’s sport was up to date and that we are on par with commercial stations, which resulted in the job I have now. So, be proactive. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Share a few of the specific challenges you’ve faced so far in your career. Not being taken seriously is a very big one for me, whether it’s because of me being a woman or because of my personality. It’s not a pleasant feeling knowing what you bring to the table, and people tend to overlook you because you don’t fit into their perception of a sports anchor or whatever. So, at the moment, I’m very blessed to have two jobs in sports broadcasting. It’s all worth it!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How do you attain work-life balance? This is going to sound like a cliche: which it probably is… but my job doesn’t feel like a job.I really love what I do. I’m able to live my passion and that helps with keeping the balance. Although there are some days you feel overworked, especially when the Springboks are losing!A good gym session or a weekend away with friends always helps..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you give to others, looking to follow in your footsteps?Try everything until you find what you love, then run with it.     #FlashbackFriday with @aphiwe_q04 receiving MOM vs UCT.

Watch it, live it, chat about it, take part in it. Then you ask yourself, “Where do I want to work or be one day?” Then devise a plan to get there. No one suddenly reaches their goal. Even though sometimes it feels that way, they work towards it. Then you put your head down and you work very hard every day to get there.Seems Louw has well on her way to reaching her goal of hosting and presenting her own sports lifestyle TV show on SuperSport and exploring every corner of the world in search of the finest cup of coffee.
