I completed my official tertiary studies over a decade ago. My study story is probably similar to that of most – suddenly school’s coming to an end and you don’t really have any idea what you want to study at tertiary level.This is how that next scary part went for me – how I directed “The Rest of My Life”:Do what you loveI’d always enjoyed writing, so a journalism degree was the obvious choice. I’d chosen psychology as my second major, though I ended up enjoying the undergrad psychology content so much, I decided to focus on that for my honours year. I passed well and was ready to enter the world of work. But one does not simply study psychology to honours level then start working in the field (sob), so instead, I fell back on my first love – journalism.As a strong motivator for lifelong learning, it makes sense to pursue something you love. If you work in online marketing, it makes sense to learn more about social media advertising. If you’re in sales, it makes sense to learn about the customer purchasing journey. But. It doesn’t make sense to spend time and money on something you don’t actually enjoy. Choose wisely!<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438626.jpg" alt="How to choose a career if you have no idea what you want to do" width="120" height="120">How to choose a career if you have no idea what you want to doSome young people know from an early age what they want to be when they grow up.

But journalism had changed since then. Today, journalism means you’re constantly on the go, adding bits, refining others.You’re skimming Google Alerts, scrolling through Facebook feeds for user-generated breaking news, embedding tweets, cropping images, overlaying logos, getting someone else to scan for typos and finally pressing ‘publish’ – often all in the space of an hour.A few of my favourite sites for staying up to date with current trends and changes in the digital sphere are: Mashable, Moz, TrendWatching, SmartInsights and We are Social Media.    Snapped in action laughing, learning, brainstorming and workshopping at today’s @brandlovecxp potent digital storytelling workshop. coverage on @bizcommunity soon! ��: @johan_brandlove #workworkwork #reporterlife A post shared by  Leigh Andrews (@ramblinglitchi123) on Mar 16, 2018 at 4:43am PDT The point of lifelong learning is to make career changes or challenges that much more manageable. The work landscape is always evolving and it will continue to do so. What happens when you commit to staying up to speed – in your career and your passions – is that you evolve and move with the times. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437743-120x120.jpg?3" alt="The ladies of the first ever SheSays Cape Town panel.

Thanks to the internet and various formats available, you can educate yourself in many different ways: workshops, online courses, masterclasses and talks by trailblazers. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/441856-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gleb TV © –" width="120" height="120">Social storytelling 101: Stop and sharpen your marketing axeOn Friday, 18 May 2018, Cape Town's marketing set descended on the Park Inn Radisson, for Meltwater's latest Biz Breakfast session with Treeshake's Dave Duarte on the art of social storytelling...By Leigh Andrews 24 May 2018The options are there.

Formal lectures may have set me up for the real-world, but nothing beats being a sponge and learning new ways to be better at what you do. Red & Yellow is widely known for the framed picture that says “I am a sponge” which hangs in the entrance of the Cape Town campus. It is the quintessential phrase that speaks to lifelong learning. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/404968-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Plan ahead to avoid this situation, at all costs!

The more you learn, the more you know. The more you know, the more you grow. And so it goes.
