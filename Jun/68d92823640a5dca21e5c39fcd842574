It will be an overwhelmingly vibrant show fuelled with gifted creativity.”At the startThe first Decorex exhibition was held at Johannesburg’s Gallagher Estate in 1994 in one show hall featuring 144 exhibitors. Themed ‘Harmony in Colour’, the inaugural décor and design show attracted 26,000 visitors and the popular exhibition continued to grow in numbers and exhibitors from then. The 2017 Decorex Joburg exhibition spanned eight halls, including the co-located exhibition 100% Design SA, at the original venue – now Gallagher Convention Centre – with more than 700 exhibitors showcasing quality furniture, décor and design products and accessories to 54 615 inspired visitors.Returning performersIn addition to the innovative style which has set the industry standard in décor exhibitions, Decorex Joburg has a number of welcome constants forming part of the show’s fabric. Headline sponsors, Plascon, have supported the annual exhibitions for the past 25 years and continue to play a vital role within the exhibition space. The 2018 Plascon installation promises a colourful décor feature with on-trend design inspiration with expert product guidance creating an enticing space for all visitors.Also featuring for the 25th showcase is the professional interior design representative body, The African Institute for Interior Design Professions (IID) leading floor manufacturer, Belgotex Floors, and quality carpet manufacturer, Nouwens. Another prominent name associated with Decorex Joburg is exhibition patron, Stephen Falcke. An award-winning interior designer, Falcke has showcased his globally-inspired talents at the event for the past 24 years. This year will see Falcke return to his favourite design showcase, taking on another inspired project that keeps the Decorex brand so in demand.Commenting on this collaborative journey, Falcke said: “I’ve been a part of Decorex since its inception and it is truly an honoured position to be patron of this incredible exhibition. To have all these amazing designs and different people that make up our interesting trade family, all under one roof, is really such an exciting experience, and I look forward to it every year.” Innovative growthThe growth of Decorex Joburg has seen an extension of the trade element to include 100% Design South Africa in 2014. This leading design space features more than 130 local and international exhibitors displaying high-end furniture, textiles, lighting, wallpaper and product design. It also includes 60 enterprises from the South African Craft Collective (SACC), a proudly South African feature of handmade home, gift and fashion accessories suited to the local and international market. This year, Decorex Joburg will welcome the inclusion of the International Sourcing Fair (ISF), a trade focused exhibition space dedicated to sourcing and purchasing of retail and commercial products, exclusively focusing on the home, gift, office and hospitality sectors.Behind the scenesDecorex Joburg is backed by globally-renowned exhibitions company, Reed Exhibitions, a leading global events’ organisation with more than 100 years of combined industry experience.
