We understand that especially in the case of someone who has been tasked with this seemingly easy project, designing an impressive exhibition stand which will achieve your main objectives, could turn into a total disaster! To be honest, even exhibitors who have previously undergone the planning of an execution process of a successful expo stand, still consult with us regularly for guidelines and fresh ideas.The key to a successful exhibition stand starts by selecting a credible and experienced supplier. Ensure this supplier understands your main objectives within the project, your brand identity, timeframes and the ever important budget.We recommend suppliers that offer an all in one solution. In some industries, it is the most effective to approach individual suppliers and cut-out the middle-man, in exhibitions, however, your best option is to choose a partner that can provide a full turnkey service. Most suppliers in the industry already have agreements in place with other providers and are already working on site, this immediately negates the risk around tricky logistics, tracking multiple deadlines and venue access etc. Secondly, the design of an exhibition stand has a direct impact on reaching your return on investment, not only does a stand have to be aesthetically pleasing but it also has to have the right traffic flow and product placement if you are doing displays.
