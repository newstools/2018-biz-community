What they didn’t tell the nervous White, initially at least, was that the car was going to drive him along Chapman’s peak Drive – and not the other way around.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/442754-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#NewCampaign: Mercedes-Benz returns to Chapman's Peak w/ Net#work BBDO" width="120" height="120">#NewCampaign: Mercedes-Benz returns to Chapman's Peak w/ Net#work BBDOMercedes-Benz and Net#work BBDO today released the S-Class content piece that returns to the famous Chapman's Peak accident that Christopher White survived 30 years ago...By Jessica Tennant 30 May 2018This is because the S-Class is equipped with Merc’s latest “autonomous driving” technology, which effectively meant that most of the drive – and particularly the really hairy part, coming up to the corner where he went off originally – would be a “hands-off” experience for White.Merc and Net#work BBDO’s documentary – all 5 minutes of it – captures all the elements perfectly and is wonderful entertainment, but all the while emphasising the point that Mercedes-Benz vehicles are “still engineered” to be the best in the world.I am not sure where this is going to be distilled into a TV ad – it should be because it is great viewing… and I hope those involved do more than putting it out on the Internet and social media.So, Orchids all round for first-class, hands-on advertising.It is an interesting irony that one of the founders of Net#work BBDO is Mike Schalit, one of the all-time great creative South African ad people. It was he who was in charge of the creative team at the then Hunt Lascaris who produced another classic local ad in response to the Merc Chapman’s Peak one.Using a BMW Five Series sedan, Schalit and co filmed it travelling around all the bends on Chapman’s at speed – and not going off over the cliff. The point: if you were in a Five, you wouldn’t have gone off in the first place. They called it “Beats the Bends” – and the ad only flighted for three nights over a weekend, because Hunts correctly predicted Mercedes would object and the ad would be pulled by the Advertising Standards Authority… as it was.The other interesting point about the latest ad is that, in this country particularly, autonomous driving is a long way from becoming a reality. Much of the technology relies – as it did in taking White around Chapman’s Peak – on clear road markings and signs. These you will find on Chapman’s Peak because it is now a toll road. You won’t find this everywhere else in this country, where the opposite is often the norm.So, in reality, to try to sell a car in South Africa based on its autonomous driving capabilities is actually reckless. At least Mercedes-Benz are not doing that…The amazing Test between the Boks and England was not only great entertainment but a fairy tale debut for the first African Springbok captain, Siya Kolisi. It was an appropriate moment to reflect on how far we have come, in a sporting sense, as a nation. (Probably not far enough, in the eyes of people like Ashwin Willemse, but that is another issue).<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/443786.jpg" alt="Grid Worldwide launches new FNB Springboks campaign" width="120" height="120">Grid Worldwide launches new FNB Springboks campaignWhen FNB announced their partnership with Springboks in 2017 it was a natural next step to show how FNB has been helping rugby in our country from grassroots all the way to Springbok level...Issued by Grid Worldwide 6 Jun 2018FNB, as a sponsor of Springbok rugby, has put up a lot of money (and a lot into airing costs, too) for an ad which reminds us about grassroots rugby, and how talent is lying there, waiting to be unearthed, if only given the opportunity. Talent like Ashwin Willemse…The ad is a bit cheesy, but its heart is in the right place, so it gets a second Orchid, for FNB and Grid Worldwide, as well as director Greg Grey. Perhaps, one day, sport will unite us…
