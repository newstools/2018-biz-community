The team is really excited as they have seen first-hand how something which is available in shops can be made by themselves.”Two of the team members are already looking for ways in which they could teach more people in their community (Westbury and Zandspruit) to make the bags. It is the first time that her team came to her on their own accord after a project is delivered, saying; “This is great, can we teach more people in our communities to make this?”They estimate that with streamlined production, every 15 bags ordered equates to one day’s employment for an intern at KanyeKanye.  They managed to include the whole team in the training process, where they worked together as either two or three people on a section, and then rotated giving everyone the opportunity to gain the full skillset to produce the product while gaining insight in the practical importance of teamwork. “We really appreciate the support from the On the Dot team. With corporate orders like this, our team not only learns proper production line work, but the importance of teamwork had also become apparent very quickly," says Bianca.  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/446866.jpg" alt="On the Dot supports KanyeKanye - driven to do good, whilst doing good business" width="335" height="252">“Using traditional techniques with modern materials, Powered by KanyeKanye - Headlines is proudly South African.
