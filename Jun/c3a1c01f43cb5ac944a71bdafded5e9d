In a production or manufacturing environment such as printing, packaging and signage, these elements can be reduced by producing work which is of an undeniably high standard.Quality in the South African printing, packaging and signage market is generally of a very high standard with printers in all sectors striving to give their clients world-class work. Obviously the capabilities of your equipment place certain limitations on what you can produce but your ability to produce award-winning work depends on how you overcome those limitations by pushing the bounds as far as possible. Company size is irrelevant.So, what will the judges be looking for in order to give you the best possible score for your printed work?With 54 categories in The GAPP Awards, it is difficult to sum it up in a few words. Each category will have specific requirements that have to be met and entries will be scored according to how well they meet those requirements. You know what constitutes good quality and if it meets your stringent standards it should be good enough for the judges. Look at your work critically and if you are satisfied that it is your best work it stands an equal chance to anyone else's work which has been entered.For example, in the litho categories, judging is broken down into four weighted sections. The first is Technical Excellence. This focuses on aspects such as the resolution, the line screen ruling, whether the piece is in register and the structure of the dots among others. This aspect of the judging carries the highest score. The second is Degree of Difficulty and looks at such things as the number of passes, the substrate used, the equipment used and the sheet size. The third is Overall Impact and looks at the first impression of the overall product, the general appearance, innovation regarding techniques and substrates among others. In these categories, Finishing Quality is the final aspect and counts the least number of points. Compare this to the Folding and Finishing category where far more attention will be placed on factors such as alignment of printed elements, fit of the cover or accuracy and neatness of the glue or stitch placement. In the digital printing categories, while many of the factors which come under scrutiny will be similar to those in the litho categories, certain variations have to be taken into account due to the printing process. Also, while many digital printing companies will rely on the standard settings of the device, there are others who take the additional step of creating their own profiles for printing based on their experience and the desire to achieve improved quality levels. This will have to be taken into account and will certainly influence the score. In the flexo section of the Packaging sector repeatability is clearly going to be important. Judging whether there is consistency throughout the job. It is good to be able to lay down a quality image but it is actually more important that the quality of the printed job be consistent from the beginning of the run to the very end. Colour variations, density fluctuations and the image moving in and out of register can only be judged across multiple repeats. In addition, flexo printing is often based on multi-colour printing. While this can negatively influence print quality, the ability to accurately reproduce the image will obviously count for higher scores.When considering the large-format categories which addresses all different types of printing handled on large-format printers, the requirements will vary quite considerably according to what is being printed, what the application for the print will be, the substrate used and the intended lifespan of the print. You must just look at your entries and find the very best products to enter. While these technical aspects are obviously important, there are other things which you have to keep in mind. Let's consider the large-format sector. In the 2016 GAPP Awards one entire category was disqualified by the judges because the entrants did not adhere to the entry requirements. The specific category called for a 1x1 metre reprint of the respective image. In every single case the entrants submitted a reproduction of the job reduced to the size 1x1 metre. The judges determined that this had not met the entry requirements and correctly refused to judge that entire category. Follow the guidelines laid out to the letter. The competition has been expanded considerably to allow more people to enter and to find the right category for every type and style of job. The best advice is to look at the entry very closely and determine the attributes of the job and where they fit the best. Fortunately, the judges have the ability to move entries into more appropriate categories if they feel that they will be better served in a different category.On the point of selecting entries, the idea would be to select and enter your very best work. There is little point in spending the money to enter anything less than your very best. We cannot tell you how or what to enter but hopefully these small tips will help you to look at your work in a slightly different light with a view to improving quality - and that benefits everyone, you, your staff, your company, your clients and the industry as a whole. Have faith in your capabilities, back your quality and enter. You could walk away with GOLD!Visit www.thegappawards.co.za.
