The NXT LVL experience is the all-expenses paid for trip to Durban for the Durban July weekend, inclusive of the return flights to Durban, two nights' accommodation at a hotel in Durban, meals and refreshments for the duration of the trip, comedy night, pre-party, VIP access at the Gagasi FM red star experience at the Durban July main event as well as the VIP access at a premium Shisanyama outlet on the Sunday of the Durban July weekend. Abey Mokgwatsane, Managing Executive: Brand at Vodacom, had this to say: “I have no doubt that the collaboration between Gagasi FM Red Star Experience and Vodacom will surely amplify the Durban July experience for our customers. The Vodacom Durban July is built on a very rich history, and it gives us great pleasure to be able to partner with Gagasi FM Red Star to create an experience that will resonate with our younger consumer market as well.” Another ground-breaking roll-out element of the campaign is its multi-channel roll-out composition where the call to action for consumers to take part will be carried on three influential regional radio stations. Gagasi FM for the KwaZulu-Natal market, YFM for the Gauteng market and Heart FM for the Western Cape market. The competition is open to young people between the ages of 18 and 25 based in these three Provinces. To enter, qualifying customers must SMS Gagasi FM, YFM or Heart FM to 31118 and successfully sign up for NXT LVL contracts before 22 June at midnight. Other than the NXT LVL experience, 100 customers to successfully sign up will each win a set of double general access tickets to the Gagasi FM Red Star Experience.“This is a very exciting partnership for both brands, with Vodacom being ‘Red’ as the brand and being the headline sponsor for the overall Durban July, and Gagasi FM Red Star Experience being a growing property within that space and offering a premium ‘Red’ experience, the alignment is only natural. We also identified the strategic fit between Gagasi FM’s target audience which is primarily youthful, as well as Vodacom’s NXT LVL which talks to consumers under the age of 25, this fit allows us to achieve synergies in terms of how we structure our campaign roll-out and messaging. The involvement of our other partner radio stations in the campaign further strengthens the campaign muscle and audience reach, and to us this is a game changer,” says Gagasi FM Head of Brand, Phinda Magwaza.This year’s Gagasi FM Red Star Experience promises to be another spectacular affair, with artist performances such as Shimza, Dladla Mshunqisi, Tipcee, Unathi, Professor, OkMalumKoolKat, Brenda Mtambo, Vusi Nova, Mondli Ngcobo & Merlon, Prince Kaybee, Busiswa, Zakwe, Zanda Zakuza, Cici, Joocey, Amanda Mo, Max-Hoba, Beast, Morena Da Square, Thami, Tebogo and Nadia Nakai.They will be performing alongside Gagasi FM DJs, Sphectacular & DJ Naves, Junior Da Rocka, DJ LeSoul, King Sfiso, DJ Vumar, DJ Sonic and DJ Mario.
