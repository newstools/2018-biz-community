“After an initial three years with M&C Saatchi Abel, we decided to launch an internal advertising and promotions division,” explains Chris Weylandt. “However, our growth in recent years allied to our future growth plans, necessitated a rethink. We realised the critical role for a strategic and creative communications partner to help navigate our business to the next level. We have no doubt the team at M&C Saatchi Abel will be the right partners for our journey."“I have enjoyed a great relationship with the Weylandts team over many years. Together with the partners at M&C Saatchi Abel, we have developed powerful thinking and work for the brand. It is great to have the opportunity to be involved in the next chapter of the brand’s journey,” says Jacques Burger, Founding Partner and Group Executive at M&C Saatchi Abel.The Weylandts win follows shortly on the back of M&C Saatchi Abel winning both the Lexus and Automark (Toyota Group’s Used car brand) accounts earlier this year.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/444476.jpg" alt="Weylandts comes home to M&amp;C Saatchi Abel" width="600" height="896">
