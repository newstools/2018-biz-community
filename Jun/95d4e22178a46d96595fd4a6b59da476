Durbanâ€™s InterCement team has already committed to adding 15 people to help in the clean-up operation. Staff and volunteers will be given gloves and recycled Uzwelo Bags to carry the litter. Pictured are Tyron Govender and Donovan Pelser of Expand a Sign, with Sai Surajbali and Zamo Sithole. For more information, visit www.uzwelo.co.za.
