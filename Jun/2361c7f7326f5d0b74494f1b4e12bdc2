<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/446409.jpg" alt="Zwelethu Radebe directs new Mutzig beer ad" width="615" height="244">The spot tells the story of the rise of a fashion designer, Pascal, from the perspective of his best friend. “I really fell in love with the poetry of having Pascal’s story told through the perspective of his long-time friend,” says Zwelethu. “There’s an honesty that comes with a witnessed journey, that’s different from a subjective personal experience.” Zwelethu used a three-act structure of setup, conflict and resolution, similar to the technique used in his short film, The Hangman, which won 10 international awards last year. “Story is king for me,” says Zwelethu. “It was the key ingredient in making a compelling and memorable film that evoked an emotional response from the audience.” The ad’s pace comes both from the camera itself and a slow-building track from Simon Ringrose (Sibot). Currently screening in Cote d’Ivoire, Congo, the DRC and Rwanda, Batik Success was conceptualised by creative director Ashley Bacon and art director Paddy Pearson, with Keren van Staden as client service and Tenille Abrahams producing for M&C Saatchi Africa.  Batik Success describes a Mutzig moment as ‘when the best of the best comes together in life.’ By that definition, Zwelethu had his own Mutzig moment on set, working with a dream crew in DOP Fabian Vettiger, art director William Boyes, stylist Richard de Jager, and editor Stephen du Plessis.   Zwelethu’s also recently released ads for Castle Lager and Debonairs. See more of his work at https://eggfilms.tv/south-african-commercials-director/zwelethu-radebe/.

About Zwelethu RadebeZwelethu spent much of his youth behind the lens, recreating his favourite film scenes with nothing but an 8mm camcorder, his BMX and his younger brother as the actor. By the time he was cast as a caricature of cricket legend Lance ‘Zulu’ Klusener in a washing powder commercial, the film bug had its fangs in deep. Zwelethu finished top of his class throughout film school, winning numerous awards and the bursaries he needed to fund his studies. The trend continued at his first Loeries, where, just months after graduating, he won a Student Silver for Ster-Kinekor Thato. Still in his 20s, Zwelethu has spent a busy last four years directing commercials full-time for both local and international agencies and clients, shooting in nine countries across Africa and Europe. In 2017, he won a Silver Apex Award for Creative Effectiveness for Strongbow, as well as Best South African Short Film at the Durban, Jozi and Shnit film festivals and Best African Short Film at Zanzibar International Film Festival for The Hangman, among other accolades.
