Harris explains: Rarely seeing other diverse professionals, despite knowing that, although underrepresented, we are there, contributing to the creative economy of the world – and winning awards.According to CNBC, diversity was the big talking point at Cannes Lions 2017 with the launch of the Unstereotype Alliance, with big brands focused on just the importance of diversity of race in advertising but also gender, sexuality and disability.In this regard, CNBC interviewed actor Sir Ian McKellen at his first ever Cannes Lions on the topic of diversity – more specifically, his drive to push for more authentic, representative storytelling:Inspiring the next generation of global creativesWhere age is concerned, expect a fresher perspective on Cannes Lions than before in 2018.

It’ll feature British Vogue editor in chief Edward Enninful, Westworld actress Thandie Newton, Omnicom chief diversity office and Adcolor founder and president Tiffany R. Warren, as well as HP marketing chief Antonio Lucio. This comes as an extension of the overall HP diversity drive, in which the brand goes so far as to ensure that each agency it works with consistently focuses on improving the number of women and people of colour working on the HP business, with diversity scorecards aimed at upping those figures each year.AdWeek confirms HP’s new programme will add to the youthful sparkle of the industry, in helping develop talent in sending more diverse creatives to Cannes. A total of 18 young creatives – up from the initial 15, as Facebook has since partnered on the programme and selected three of the 4A’s Multicultural Advertising Intern Programme interns to join the group.Chosen from across the US, UK and Mexico to attend Cannes Lions, there will be a particular focus on the mentoring and networking events but also beyond the Festival itself, by developing a post-festival plan for each participant.The idea is that each person will go on to inspire change and champion diversity within the industry.For this pilot year, the participants were selected from HP’s roster of agencies—BBDO, Edelman, Fred & Farid, Giant Spoon and PHD— but HP intends to extend the programme in future years. Taking #MoreLikeMe beyond Cannes LionsThe first-ever #MoreLikeMe programme will doubtless inspire the industry at large while inspiring for the next generation of global creatives.AdWeek adds that HP will be the first brand to partner with The Female Quotient group dedicated to championing diversity in the workplace – another programme set to kick off at Cannes.The Drum adds that HP was also the first to sponsor the Free the Bid non-profit initiative, spearheaded by director Alma Har’el. Free the Bid asks agencies to include a female director on every triple-bid project. The year before, none of the HP films were directed by women. After the diversity challenge, nearly 60% of HP’s global campaign films have been directed by women – all Free the Bid directors.Seems we’ll see lots #MoreLikeMe post #CannesLions2018, keep your eyes peeled!Read moreSOUTH AFRICA<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/444022-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertising" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertisingThe Unstereotype Alliance launched at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity last year and has just joined Twitter.
