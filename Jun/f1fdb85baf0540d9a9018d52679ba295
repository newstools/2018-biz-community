<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/444024.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertising" width="625" height="417">The topic of unsterotyping advertising and using lazy gender troped keeps popping up where creativity is celebrated, but it's sadly not mainstream just yet. Perhaps the fact that the Unsterotype Alliance has finally joined Twitter will sway the movement over social media.Global brand Unilever popularised the hashtag in 2016 and it was the focus of a special report during the 2017 Cannes Lions, where the yellow ‘Unsterotype Alliance flag flew high, with AdAge reporting that, “The UN believes ads can turn the tide in long-losing war for gender equality.”UN Believes Advertisers Can Bring Gender Equality https://t.co/AqZsACy3vh— Pelle Sjoenell (@pellesjoenell) June 24, 2017<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1607/352127.jpg" alt="Removing stereotypes in advertising - Unilever launches #unstereotype" width="120" height="120">Removing stereotypes in advertising - Unilever launches #unstereotypeTo remove the stereotypes in advertising, Unilever announced at Cannes #unstereotype, its global ambition for all of its brands and the industry at large to advance advertising away from stereotypical portrayals of gender...18 Jul 2016AdAge explained that the UN Women was effectively convening a ‘Security Council of the ad industry’, when the Unstereotype Alliance programme kicked off in Cannes,  with the idea that advertising can “do what more than two decades of UN proclamations, local laws and good intentions haven't -- spur real progress on gender issues.” SA’s own Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of UN Women, added:No country in the world has achieved gender equality, even though we have big initiatives and laws passed… Changing laws didn't do much to change cultural norms. Advertising has skill in behaviour change.With support from other global brands, including Procter & Gamble, Mars, Diageo, Johnson & Johnson and Mattel, Aline Santos, senior VP marketing at Unilever, said at the time that having “left all Axe's lad humour behind,” they’ve since found that ads without stereotypes have considerably better results. A big, brave, progressive play from Unilever. Will it still sell deodorant?  I hope so.

Unilever's chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed commented on the launch of the WFA’s guide:We’ve started to see real progress,s but it doesn’t yet go far enough or wide enough. Our job won’t be done as long as ads still diminish or limit the role of women and men in society.Mlambo-Ngcuka, adds:We know that harmful stereotypes of both women and men have a deep impact on how we see and treat each other. Intentionally changing those images has huge potential to positively transform our culture and bring us closer to true, inclusive equality… This change will help us to collectively realise the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals – to leave no one behind. And yes, this is only this first step… "Addressing gender stereotypes is only the first step..."
