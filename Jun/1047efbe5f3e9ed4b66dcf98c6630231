He then mimicked the ways of the Undercover Boss TV show by touring as an intern through a variety of digital companies. Frese says of the experience:It made me much poorer but a lot smarter.Frese also used the time to get behind a number of startups that remain a core focus, as Kolle Rebbe is strong on startup support.Not only has Frese won a number of national and international awards in his personal capacity, but during his time at Jung von Matt, the agency was recognised as both Germany's ‘Agency of the Year’ and as ‘Independent Agency of the Year’.Who better as a film, radio and audio advertising jury resident, then?<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/440976-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Swati Bhattacharya, Nicolas Courant, Sebastian Padilla and Fabian Frese.

Each is a leader in their fields and cover the range of film, radio, digital, out-of-home, print and design sub-sectors of the advertising and brand communication industry.Here, Frese lets us in on his judging expectations, his unforgettable experiences in this part of Africa and what he’s expecting from this year’s film and radio advertising entries….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Congratulations on being appointed as jury president for the Loeries! What does this mean to you personally?In the past years I´ve been invited to judge all the big shows. But it's very different to be invited as one of the few selected “foreigners” to such a prestigious award.  And being president is an honour that doesn't happen too often..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Have you been to South Africa before? Let us in on your past experiences here. I’d been on holidays to Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco but those were typical holidays, the type where you don't get to know the real country. Then, about twenty years ago I visited some of my friends who spent a year studying in Cape Town.It was my first time in this part of Africa, and an unforgettable experience. Drinking Springboks on Long Street (I’m still hung over), watching whales on the Garden Route, getting stuck in Swaziland, diving in Mozambique... But also getting a sense for the problems in that part of the world. A trip I'll always rememberIn the last few years I’ve regularly come back to South Africa to shoot commercials, mainly in Cape Town.  And just recently, I spent a couple of days in the south of Kruger Park to produce the #LifeChangingPlaces campaign for Lufthansa – a once-in-a-lifetime experience!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to from the 2018 Loeries judging experience and Creative Week in August? Meeting great people, getting inspired by a culture that is so different to mine and seeing creative work you normally don't see anywhere else. And having a couple of beers with some friends I met in juries within the last years!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You’ll also speak at the DStv Seminar of Creativity during Creative Week, share the essence of what attendees can expect.I'm not sure yet. Maybe I'll simply do a recap of the 2014 Fifa World Cup semifinal Brazil vs Germany (1:7)! But I might switch to a topic that could be more useful for creatives. For example, how to create great ideas in times of shrinking budgets. No wait, I'll do that World Cup thing!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Haha, we will have to wait and see! What’s the biggest trend in advertising that you expect to see from this year’s entries? To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. From an international perspective, you see that campaigns get more and more integrated.There is that one big idea in the centre and the campaign’s architecture around it is very well thought-through. And we stop using that one key visual in every channel, pretending to think integrated.I’m curious to see how technology will have an impact on this year’s ideas. For example, VR and AR are just at the beginning and maybe we'll see some work that takes it a bit further.Lots to look forward to.
