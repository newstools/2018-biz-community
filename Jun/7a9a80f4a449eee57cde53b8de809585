The definition of CCM has had to shift from being document output related to encompass customer communications in their entirety, which means moving toward a digital view and approach.How do you move toward a digital CCM strategy?Knowing that customers want information on demand that is hyper-relevant, contextual and in the channel of their choice, it’s worth evaluating your own levels of digital maturity. Are you providing what your customers want? If not, how far off are you from being able to do so?By benchmarking yourself against the best in the business, you can get a sense of how digital your DNA is.This is especially important when it comes to customer communications, which are key to the digital transformation process.Remember, your customers are already digitally transformed. If you still think that sending out a PDF version of an invoice or account means that you’re digitally transformed, then you’ve completely missed the potential of truly digital customer communications. That’s the first step in a long journey on transforming documents digitally.Interactive, hyper-relevant and contextual informationDigital is not a world where static documents need to reside. There are a whole host of digital tools available which enable you to provide interactive, hyper-relevant and contextual information to your customers as part of their essential billing document.It’s also worth stating that things aren’t about to get any easier for companies which haven’t fully embraced digital transformation. The world is moving at hyper speed when it comes to digital evolution and companies need to start embracing that change, which includes the ever-important documents.It’s therefore imperative that companies continually adjust their digital transformation efforts with one eye on the future.Here is one way to go about doing that:Evaluate and understand where you sit in your digital maturity and where you need to get toMap out the current digital customer experienceDefine the steps to a digitally transformed, fully omnichannel experience with a single view of the customerMap the strategic changes to get thereBreak into mini-projects with reasonable timelinesMeasure progress along the wayConsistently evaluate and promote changeNo matter how digitally mature you think you are, you should hold strategic customer journey mapping sessions to determine how you can continue to progress and what the roadmap should look like in both the short and long terms.Remember, this isn’t a destination, it’s a journey. What your customers want from your communications will change over time. Ideally, you should be ready and waiting for them when it does.
