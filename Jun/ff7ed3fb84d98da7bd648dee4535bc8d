All entrants into the IABC Africa Silver Quill Awards will be encouraged to enter the 2019 global awards programme, which will be presented at an Excellence Gala as part of the IABC's World Conference in 2019. The Quill Awards are unique in the industry because they recognise work that makes a significant contribution to business outcomes. Evaluators will review each entry against IABC's standard of excellence, encouraging the pursuit of excellence rather than competition. Evaluators particularly look for entries where communicators are able to demonstrate the impact their work had on business goals and are innovative and unique."Local communicators produce exceptional work, which deserves to be recognised on the global stage," says Carol Allers, IABC Africa regional chairperson. She adds, "The IABC African Silver Quill Awards not only recognises local communication excellence, but also helps to prepare entrants for the global Gold Quills programme. Entrants are guaranteed a thorough judging process, followed by detailed feedback to help prepare for the global awards entry."
