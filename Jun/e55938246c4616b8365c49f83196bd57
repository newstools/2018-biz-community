There’s little doubt that mobile is the first device consumers use to surf the web, access social media and email, download apps and follow news. Add geo-location, AR, VR and chatbots and it’s clear that mobile is making a major impact on how we consume and engage with content, companies and each other. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/446139.jpg" alt="MMA Smarties entrants must highlight business results in 2018 submissions to win" width="300" height="117">This relentless innovation is what the MMA (Mobile Marketing Association) Smarties Awards gives credence to, judging and awarding the very best in class in mobile’s undoubted marketing magic.Taking place this year on 1 November at the Maslow, Sandton, the closing date for entries to be submitted is getting close: All submissions across 23 categories are due by 29 June. Use this link to enter.  Part of the global MMA, the South African arm of the SMARTIES recognises and honours campaigns entered into one or two of the global, EMEA and local categories, or all three if they have a global winner on their hands, and that showcase business impact success. Sarah Utermark, MMA SA Country Director says, “40% of an entry is judged on its results i.e. business impact. Creative, strategy and execution then each account for 20%.” Eligible entries must have been active in the marketplace between June 2017 and June 2018.How to win a Smartie“An entry should read like a story, so make it interesting and compelling. Present its case in a clear, concise and simple manner. And ensure substance and business impact is at its core,” says Utermark. She suggests using charts and graphs to show how results tied to objectives and how this impacted the business in a tangible way. “If using video, make sure that it complements the written entry form and is not a duplicate. Judges also like to see examples of the work so include as many as possible, providing they are relevant to the campaign,” she adds. Study winning case studiesIn 2017, Durex and Havas Boondoggle’s The Big O won a Gold SMARTIE in the Mobile Social category. Why? Because it demonstrated exceptional engagement, reach and social impact through its mobile channels, but most importantly, great results with a 37% increase in sales “Use past winners as guides to understand what judges look for, especially the results, and how they presented their submissions.” Visit a selection of winning international and local campaigns here. So important are results to the Smarties that the MMA global launched its Business Impact Index (BII) earlier this year, setting an index benchmark to sit alongside the creativity, innovation and execution of the marketing campaigns submitted to the MMA Smarties. The MMA continues to show the way forward for marketers, agencies and technology providers to grow their businesses, getting ever closer to answering the question - what does “good” look like in mobile.All 2018 Smarties winners will automatically be entered into 2019’s BII. “The Smarties is an opportunity for local best in class mobile marketers to showcase excellence and business impact success.
