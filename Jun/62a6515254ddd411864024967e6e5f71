Our philosophy is that if we can lower the cost of production by owning the assets, we will be able to pass on these cost savings to our clients.The Small Works Unit is run by our lead flighting team. "We see this operation as a great opportunity to further the skillsets of our employees who have been with the company for many years," says Martin Rosen, MD of MegaVision Media. We produce all types of frames and signage and we will be using the space to focus on new product development to enhance our branding efforts at store level.
