I’ve managed every element of this journey, and I’m grateful to Vega for instilling a holistic way of thinking in us.”The app is still in its early development phases, and Casanova has been invited to meet with high level investors in China later this year, which will potentially help him find safe passage into the Chinese market. “Securing my position in the Chinese market would almost be like accomplishing the impossible, especially considering that Facebook and the rest of my competitors are banned in China. China also has over 640 million smart phone users, a number that seems to epicly double the United States entire population.”For more information on IIE qualifications available to study at Vega and other career-building opportunities, visit www.vegaschool.com.
