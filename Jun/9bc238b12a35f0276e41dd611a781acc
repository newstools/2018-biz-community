Last year the Cadbury shelves were awash with the first ‘Collect all the Martians’ on-pack promotion. The response was so positive that this year, four new Martians have been created, along with four brand new 150g slabs – inspired by South Africa’s favourite chocolate bars.The creative challenge for the Just Design Jhb team was two-fold, firstly, achieving the right balance and communication of the promotional and ‘Limited Edition’ message on-pack whilst still maintaining the integrity of the Cadbury brand. Secondly, how to do this without adding any additional colours or finishes to the wrapper. The solution came through a truly collaborative approach between Just Designs’ creative and finished art teams. Through their experience and understanding of the print process they were able to work with the limited number of colours available to create the different sub-brand elements and personalities, along with the necessary messaging. They then took this further by cleverly manipulating the printing plates so that different areas of the wrapper carry varying levels of metallic intensity creating depth and movement to the final design. Look out for Cosmo, Cupido, Buzz and Luna as they invade the confectionary aisles and get stuck into some truly delicious chocolate. We are ready to be abducted, especially if the tests involve tasting! #JOYOFANEWKIND<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/446231.jpg" alt="The Cadbury Martians have landed!" width="600" height="682">About Just DesignFor over 15 years, Just Design has proven time and again that good thinking leads to great creative.
