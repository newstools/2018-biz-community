It’s fantastic to represent Tiso Blackstar, which is a great African media company with vision.My biggest concern about coming back to SA four years ago was that I would not have the investment to do what I needed to do in the digital space.

For work I read the Nieman Lab, CJR, Wan-Ifra Executive News Service and The Monday Note newsletters, my own websites (BusinessLIVE, TimesLIVE and SowetanLIVE), and the Financial Mail, Wanted and Vanity Fair in print. I have about three books on the go at once. I listen to lots of podcasts in Cape Town traffic: lately Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History.Tell us something about yourself not generally known.My amazing five-year-old had a kidney transplant in January, donated to her by my amazing mother. My future project is going to be lobbying government to make organ donation automatic with an opt-out, as they do in many countries around the world. We were lucky, but we have watched so many kids just waiting - and dying - while good organs go to waste, and it is devastating.
