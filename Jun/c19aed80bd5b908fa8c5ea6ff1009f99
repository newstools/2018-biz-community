After undergoing a mastectomy and chemotherapy as conventional cancer treatment, she and her life partner, David, embarked on a quest to research Complementary Alternative Medicine. In a recent interview with Longevity Live, she said that this experience inspired their mission “to create a roadmap which highlights choice and all the treatment options available to newly diagnosed cancer patients.”This mission transformed into the Forever Changed Global Awareness campaign and Dance of the Butterfly documentary. Today, the vision is to empower and educate the millions of South Africans affected by this disease. Addi and her team achieve this by working directly with cancer survivors and their families. Over and above this, the intention is to educate communities about prevention and to understand more about what it means to live with cancer, which no doubt inspires cancer survivors to move forward with their 'new' lives post cancer diagnosis - no matter what their treatment choice may be. Know. Push. Share. Do.When MediaCom South Africa discovered Addi’s story and the powerful impact she has and is making in people’s lives around the world, the company became part of her journey as a sponsor and partner. The vision and foundation for this partnership is to support best practice on cancer awareness and prevention and to create a step change in the way cancer is acknowledged, especially in the workplace. As a company that understands the powerful impact of having information and being able to make informed decisions, MediaCom, the content and connections agency, supports The Forever Changed campaign through various initiatives, which includes volunteer work, public events, educational workshops, thought leadership pieces, and promoting cancer education to all key stakeholders in the business.This is because MediaCom is focused on supporting initiatives such as this campaign, which seeks to improve the lives of people and address the serious health challenges that cancer creates. After working closely with The Forever Changed campaign, MediaCom is confident that the impact of cancer in and out of the workplace needs to be recognised in all organisations, and that proactive approaches should be put in place to help deal with it.When asked about the partnership, Addi said that MediaCom was one of the first companies to endorse and help The Forever Changed Global Awareness Campaign in its endeavours to stand up to cancer. “This provided much-needed backing and was a turning point for the campaign, as our efforts were finally recognised by an award-winning global company, who set an example in the corporate world through its policy of putting people first.” She continued that MediaCom provided the building blocks and launch pad for the very first Live Life Deliberately Wellness Programme and Cancer in the Workplace Conference. These initiatives have continued to inspire the movement to reach greater heights in awareness creation, confrontation and fight against cancer, a disease that impacts society at large. “We share in MediaCom’s behaviour policy as #KnowIt, #PushIt, #ShareIt, #DoIt.”Being leaders of long-term changeClaudelle Naidoo, MediaCom’s Head of Insights & New Business Director, echoed Addi’s words: “MediaCom will continue to lead the cancer awareness drive in the corporate sector with Forever Changed. This campaign is about being leaders of change, so that every South African that is impacted by cancer has greater support in the workplace, with more information about the options available when it comes to their treatment. MediaCom is proud to be a Forever Changed partner and intends to continue the support, the journey, and the focus on people, to improve on how we deal with and approach cancer in the workplace.”For media owners who want to learn more about this catalyst-for-change partnership, Forever Changed will be hosting a press conference on 12 July 2018, at The Palazzo Hotel, Montecasino, where MediaCom’s CEO, Ashish Williams, will be one of the keynote speakers, sharing the podium alongside a member of SA Parliament. The agenda will also focus on the release of latest clinical trial test results, which are breakthroughs in cancer treatment, and the need for a formal cancer policy in South Africa.For more information, interviews or media passes, please contact:Forever Changed Global Awareness CampaignAddi Lang on 074 973 9999 or Nizaam Holmes on homer.incs@gmail.combRev('brev-9a2b48db-5b93-48aa-9a6f-b0acf1c167cf', '>a/\<moc.liamg@scni.remoh>"moc.liamg;46#&scni.remoh:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')or visit the Forever Changed Facebook page.
