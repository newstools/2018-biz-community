The question is, ‘How do we nudge the gate, as marketers, around this culture?’ In answer to this question, he took delegates through the five pillars he believes will assist marketers in navigating the youth space.1. Brands need to have a greater purposeAccording to the study, purpose is the fourth biggest brand connector that the youth is invested in, and they believe that brands, in turn, need to invest in improving their communities.SAB is getting this right. Here’s a brand of theirs that recently took this to the next level:“Who would have thought three years ago that Carling Black Label would be taking on women and child abuse, and it just shows how brands now need to change the narrative and be involved in what’s going on in their communities."<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1704/386783-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Chinkanda on the move…" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

Understand route and channel to marketChinkanda says clients often want to go to Maboneng to reach the black youth market, but that’s not where they are. They’re at universities and shopping malls, but digital is their new playground. He provided some interesting stats:Out of the 12,000 youth they surveyed, 90% of them have cellphones, with 67% owning a smartphone. In the last minute, worldwide there have been 500 hours of video loaded on YouTube, 3.3m Facebook posts, 29m WhatsApp messages and 3.8m searches on Google. When it comes to taking photos and selfies, in 2017 alone 1.2tn digital photos were taken, of that 300m were selfies. 80% of Instagram accounts follow business accounts, and 300m accounts on Instagram are posting stories.The point is: “When you’re thinking of your marketing mix and how to take your products to market, do not ignore digital because this is the future.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1705/392467-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Catherine Bothma" width="120" height="120">Marketing to the youth of 2017Catherine Bothma, MD of HDI Youth Marketeers, presented attendees at the Sunday Times Generation Next Youth Marketing Conference on Thursday, 11 May, with the key findings from this year's study...By Jessica Tennant 16 May 20173.

Locate your brand in youth culture“We believe at HDI that our competition as marketers is everything in culture, so your brand needs to move at the speed of culture; you can’t wait.”Look at how Sanlam is selling its Indie life insurance product: Since Chinkanda started at HDI, just six months ago, they’ve looked at all these points internally and questioned whether, they, as a brand, are doing this, locating themselves in brand culture and so on, and what they’ve discovered is that they are for the next and the next, to them, is the next culture, the next job, the next degree, the next brand, the next shoe… That’s how they’re seeing the youth today. “At HDI we believe the youth are the biggest influencers of the future, and we exist to make that future meaningful.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1707/403274-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Nontokozo Madonsela" width="120" height="120">#NewCampaign: Standard Bank's nextThrough its current ‘What's your next?' integrated campaign, Standard Bank Personal and Business Banking South Africa (PBBSA) seeks to reconnect with its customers in a way that acknowledges that they're unique individuals with their own unique aspirations and ambitions, in an effort to partner with them on their journey to step up to their ‘next'...By Jessica Tennant 27 Jul 2017
