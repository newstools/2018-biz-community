It shows how close the relationship is between Mrs Balls and South Africans from all walks of life, as ‘The Mrs.’ turns the moments and meals you like into those you love.It was directed by Mzi Khumalo of Darling films with editing and post-production by Upstairs Ludus and Fuel Content, and features the 1972 R&B hit by Billy Paul, ‘Me and Mrs Jones’.
