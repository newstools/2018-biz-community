But after having lived on the Maltese islands for a year, I realise I still have a lot to learn…Binary politicsMalta’s binary political landscape (labour in power and nationalist in opposition) extends to the media landscape, since both own party newspapers, radio and television stations which frame the news according to their ideological agenda.

(For the best examples below, I am indebted to Arnold Cassola, former Alternattiva Demokratika chairman and former secretary general of the European Green Party.) Abroad, when the government of the day dishes out one contract after another by direct order to a greedy, money guzzling politician-lawyer, they call it clientelism. Here in Malta we call it ‘person of trust’. Party apparatchiksAbroad, when a Prime Minister gives four promotions in three months to his best friend who thus becomes army chief, they call it abuse of power. In Malta, it is called ‘exigencies of the service’.Abroad, when they appoint as chairmen of rehabilitation projects, of cultural capital and what not party apparatchiks, they call it abuse of power. In Malta, they justify it saying, “He cannot because he’s labour?”Abroad, when a lawyer coming from the legal office of a member of Parliament defends one of Daphne’s alleged killers, this is deemed to be a national political scandal.MALTA<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437033-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Stefan Ember -" width="120" height="120">A South African's guide to moving to and making it in Malta: The Daphne impactYou may not have heard of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who was murdered six months ago, but Meryl Streep certainly has and it would not surprise me if the Oscar winner optioned DCG's story...By Marcus 'The Maltese Falcon' Brewster 20 Apr 2018Or when an opposition politician is a sub-agent for a government-sponsored scheme selling citizenship and passports, abroad they call it opportunism. In Malta we call it: “Not everyone needs to earn a living?”Abroad, when the government dishes out public land or public hospitals very cheaply to foreign shady persons, the local judiciary immediately initiates a public enquiry. In Malta, instead, we boast that we are creating jobs.Personal capacityAbroad, when the Prime Minister and chief of staff are caught participating at the wedding of a suspected crook, the politicians concerned immediately resign or are subjected to a public investigation. In Malta, instead, this is justified by saying, “I paid for the plane ticket to get to Florence.”Abroad, when a director of the foremost newspaper in the country was present at the aforementioned wedding of the aforementioned alleged crook, he is immediately kicked out of his position. In Malta, instead, his presence is justified with the words, “I was there in my personal capacity.” Abroad, when a politician appoints as his PRO paid with public money a journalist coming from the TV station of his/her political stable, they call it nepotism. In Malta, they call it: “Because he is capable.”On an island where English is a second language, these wordsmiths are so much more than merely capable. For their corruption of the language they deserve nothing less than a backhander compliment.
