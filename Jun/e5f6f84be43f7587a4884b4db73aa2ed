To promote personal responsibility and encourage sustainable actions, a bold, permanent new entry visa process was created where all arriving visitors must now sign a pledge, stamped in their passports, to be good environmental stewards. This mandatory agreement, dedicated to Palau’s children, needs to be signed before an officer. Customs processes were changed permanently, making it the first country to incorporate environmental practices into its immigration laws:Every inbound visitor to Palau is now required to watch an in-flight short film that tells the story of a clumsy, careless giant - "representative of mass tourism at its worst - who comes to Palau, wreaking environmental damage. The local children befriend him, teaching him to be eco-aware." The film introduces passengers to the Palau Pledge, which is a new entry visa process designed to save Palau’s environment as each visitor to the island-country signs a 'passport eco-pledge' before they can enter, said to be a promise to protect Palau for future generations.
