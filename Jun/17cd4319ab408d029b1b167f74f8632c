Meeting deadlines is obviously extremely important – but it isn’t always easy to do. That’s why we’ve created a master list of a few tried and tested tips from our team that will change your approach to eventing and hopefully leave you with enough of this precious commodity to stop and take in the moment when all your hard work finally comes together.Use the good old to-do listTo-do lists can go a long way to ensure you don’t forget all the tasks you need to get done, and they’re also a great way to track how far you’ve come and how far you still need to go. Start off by getting a notebook that you won’t get tired of looking at... you’ll be taking this with you everywhere! It may seem old school but take a minimum of 30 minutes in your day to plan out what is needed for the project at hand. List the tasks you need to do and a short description of how you plan to carry them out, which will save you plenty of time when you revisit the to-do list for execution purposes.
