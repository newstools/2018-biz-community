And to further reiterate how, working courageously together in the face of adversity, anyone has the potential to make the most daunting of goals possible,” Strydom added.Filmed over three days at various locations within the Western Cape, including Stellenbosch and Grabouw, the commercial includes actual footage from Spur Schools Mountain Bike League events as well as that of the World Championship. The narrative recreates Alan’s challenges along his life journey, capturing the raw emotion of his World Championship victory.“It was crucial for the story to feel authentic, and for us to tell Alan’s tale as unobtrusively as possible. We filmed documentary-style, using an assortment of action cameras such as GoPros, Handi-cams and Arri-cameras.”“In this way, we hoped to create a more visceral connection with the audience,“ Strydom continues.Sacha du Plessis, Group Head of Marketing at Spur Corporation says: “Sports play a pivotal role in bringing communities together and giving children early life skills; something that is entrenched in Spur’s DNA. We sponsor over 500 events annually in a multitude of sports across the country and are particularly proud of the 70’000 children that have participated in the Spur Schools MTB League over the last 10 years.”Du Plessis concludes, “We chose Alan’s inspiring story as it captures the essence of a very authentic message; that ‘together anything is possible’. A message supported by our company since the inception of our brand by Allen Ambor in 1967.” Watch Spur’s ‘Together Anything is Possible’:
