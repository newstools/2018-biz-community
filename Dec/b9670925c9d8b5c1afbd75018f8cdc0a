Kiewit got his big break as a news intern at CapeTalk in 2004 before becoming a seasoned and respected journalist. Kiewit joined television in 2008 where he developed a reputation for being a tough and brave reporter with a gift for story-telling. “I’m excited to be returning to what I consider home. I started my career in journalism at CapeTalk and EWN in 2004, learning about the wonder of radio under John Maytham, Mike Wills and Charlotte Kilbane”, said new evening show host, Lester Kiewit.Kiewit added: “I live by the adage that radio is truly the theatre of the mind. I can think of no other place I’d love to be a player than at CapeTalk.” “The addition of Lester to our line-up is a home-coming for this veteran journalist who honed his skills at our station. Listeners will remember him as one of the prolific on-the-ground news reporters during his earlier tenure at CapeTalk. Lester was born and raised in Cape Town and takes great pleasure in exploring his home town and learning more about the city's history. His experience as a journalist - coupled with his history with CapeTalk – mean this familiar story-teller will return to the airwaves to unpack local and international news in a way that will capture the hearts and minds of our listeners,” said CapeTalk programme manager, Tessa van Staden.CapeTalk new line-up to take effect from January 2019:Sunday line-up:Weekend Breakfast with Africa06:00 — 10:00Solid Gold Sunday10:00 — 17:00Jazz Sessions with Gary van Dyk17:00 — 19:00SportsTalk with Marc Lewis19:00 — 21:00Lester Kiewit (Show name to be confirmed)21:00 — 23:00Late Nights with Sara-Jayne King23:00 — 01:00Monday - Thursday line-up:Early Breakfast with Abongile Nzelenzele04:00 — 06:00Breakfast with Kieno Kammies06:00 — 09:00The Eusebius McKaiser Show09:00 — 12:00The Xolani Gwala Show12:00 — 13:00Lunch with Pippa Hudson13:00 — 15:00Afternoon Drive with John Maytham Show15:00 — 18:00The Money Show with Bruce Whitfield18:00 — 20:00Lester Kiewit (Show name to be confirmed)20:00 — 23:00Late Nights with Sara-Jayne King23:00 — 01:00Join the Conversation – for the latest news and information from CapeTalk visit: www.capetalk.co.za
