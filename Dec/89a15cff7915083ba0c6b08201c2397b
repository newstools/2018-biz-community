Here's how SA companies are working for better work-life balance and pledging to transform for the better...By Leigh Andrews 3 Dec 2018Based on McKinsey's 2017 'Women and the world of work': Western Europe data, the statistics are harsh – the percentage of females entering the workforce is 43%, yet just 3% make it to C-suite level. And of those, just 1 in 17 are women of colour.It’s not all bad news though, as The United State of Women confirms that since the launch of The 3% Conference in 2012, the number of women creative directors at ad agencies and in creative leadership roles has increased to 11%. But that’s slow progress on a global level, and unfortunately, what we say and do in this regard is often different. From a practical level, it’s clear that women continue to be vastly underrepresented in the workforce, especially at senior level.Here are a few reasons why…Dispelling myths of working womenKristnasamy says we tend to talk about gender diversity more than before, but in most cases, it’s all talk, no action. Without action, the situation stays stagnant.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465642.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: Busting stereotypes of SA women in the workplace" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Busting stereotypes of SA women in the workplaceWith rising awareness that inequality needs to be tackled head-on, we're seeing more mindfulness of issues of inclusion and equality in local marketing campaigns and movements like the 7% Tribe, Take This Thread and 'Women Acknowledged'...By Leigh Andrews 29 Oct 2018Kristnasamy says women in the workplace are limited from the outset, as there tends to be an unconscious bias which is very hard to measure. Unfortunately, this is where we hear the buzz of the ‘queen bee’ syndrome, because if you’re the only one in that space, sometimes you can feel your position is under threat as they’re ‘after my job’. To get around this, Kristnasamy says we need to make an active decision to promote other females.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452598-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Code-switching and dealing with queen bees in the workplace" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Code-switching and dealing with queen bees in the workplaceThe negative impact of code-switching and tokenism, why females speak almost three times as many words a day as men and how to deal with queen bees in the workplace were hot topics at the most recent Future Females Cape Town morning session.

Only a handful of hands went up across the room when she asked if anyone was familiar with the term. Learn Liberty defines it as follows:Micro-aggressions, defined as real or perceived everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults that communicate negative or hostile messages to marginalised or 'perceived marginalised' people. This usually takes place in one-on-one conversations.An example of micro-aggression? “You’re so pretty/smart for a black girl.” This signals a lack of respect and understanding and the acting out of an inequality of power. These micro-aggressions, in turn, build up and become macro-aggression, in the form of discrimination against an entire race, gender or sexual affiliation.Kristnasamy added that when we think of sexual discrimination, many of us think of the #MeToo movement and how mind-blowing it was to see so many women across the globe chiming in with their stories.Being the “only” in the boardroomSo what do you do if you’re the only female or the only person of colour on the team or worse, in the company or overall industry? Kristnasamy said it’s not as special as it sounds.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1508/300425-120x120.jpg" alt="[#WomenInBiz] &amp;quot;I was perceived to be the marketing girl ... not the distiller&amp;quot; - Q&amp;A with Marlene Bester" width="120" height="120"> "I was perceived to be the marketing girl ... not the distiller" - Q&A with Marlene BesterFollowing a recent brandy and chocolate pairing in celebration of Women's Month, I thought I'd interview the host, who just so happens to be the only female master distiller in South Africa...By Jessica Taylor 7 Aug 2015You stand out as you’re not the norm, and being the only female represented can cause women to feel they are under greater pressure to perform, and that they are more closely watched and held to higher standards of performance, whether that’s true or not – it’s usually another unconscious bias.Explaining what to do to get around this, Kristnasamy said we need to be unorthodox and speak out in terms of policies and norms in our workplaces, so we don’t just cater for a dominant group.Kristnasamy also said, “You do you,” as doing so gives other women the space to be themselves, and empowers them in the process.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/460505-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Original illustration: © Jesús Sanz via" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Fair chance to climb the career ladder of the future?CapeTalk radio host Africa Melane served as MC for the recent #BI4Gov Behavioural Insights conference in Cape Town. After a quick tea break chat, he inspired me to share my thoughts on how we need to both be the best we can be and give a hand up, not just a hand out...By Leigh Andrews 1 Oct 2018Doing so means you’re allowing everyone to be heard, and individually making the effort to ask questions and speak up. We also need to work to recognise unconscious bias at that moment when something is said and in the moment you respond.Lastly, Kristnasamy said it’s important to respect the fact that your employees have a life beyond the office. True work-life balance is hard to achieve, but many of us are more productive when we’re away from the desk. Productivity isn’t necessarily linked to physical presence and a time commitment.Kristnasamy ended by showing the following videoThe video brought home the message of the session, to take the concept of your life, realise there are bigger challenges out there to be faced, and you can do it.Watch for more coverage of the Corinium Women in Digital and Data conference in my next few #FairnessFirst columns.
