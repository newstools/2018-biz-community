This was such a heartwarming experience because I, myself know what it’s like to grow up without toys so I know what this will mean to the kids.” Uzalo’s Masoja Msiza meanwhile added, “Wow! It was an honour to be a part of something that is greater than all of us. Well done to a diverse KZN for coming together and demonstrating such generosity.”East Coast Radio’s General Manager Boni Mchunu has thanked KZN for their big heartedness. “It’s incredible to see how our communities have come together to offer the spirit of Ubuntu to such a life changing initiative. KZN has done us very proud. All the money collected will be directed to the needs of the four schools; Jabulani primary, Maria Memorial primary, Mqhathi primary, Nqongqotho primary that were identified by the Department of Education. The funds will go a long way towards better equipping these schools and our hope is to inspire and empower our learners to reach for greatness.”
