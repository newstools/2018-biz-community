The storyline is relatively simple, and there’s a complete lack of special effects and quirky cinematography, yet it demands attention from start to finish, leaving the viewer in an agitated state, with a sense of needing to react and respond.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473806.jpg" alt="Short film from Egg Films' Zwelethu Radebe for #BeTheMentor" width="615" height="302">Originally intended only for flighting on social media channels, it has been edited into a ‘trailer’ and seven teaser spots, and will now also be screened in cinema and on television.

She attributes the powerful – almost raw – finished product to Radebe’s strength as a performance director and storyteller, pinpoint casting, steadfast advisors and trust.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473807.jpg" alt="Short film from Egg Films' Zwelethu Radebe for #BeTheMentor" width="615" height="255">“Zwelethu is an exceptional director with an uncanny ability to get the best from everyone he works with, from actors to post-production editors, and everyone in between,” she said. “For Vuka, he was supported by Mandy Sewell of Casting Initiative, who invested considerable time and effort to find a very talented cast.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473808.jpg" alt="Short film from Egg Films' Zwelethu Radebe for #BeTheMentor" width="615" height="257">“Also in his corner were Fabian Vettiger, a DOP with so much experience and an eye that only ever elevates a production; Post Modern’s William Kalmer, who was so enthused by Vuka, he far exceeded his brief; and Grant Booth, whose score is a triumph.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473809.jpg" alt="Short film from Egg Films' Zwelethu Radebe for #BeTheMentor" width="615" height="255">“Client, too, deserves kudos for being brave enough to give us carte blanche, trusting that we’d deliver something that would contribute positively to the very laudable 18+ movement,” she said. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473810.jpg" alt="Short film from Egg Films' Zwelethu Radebe for #BeTheMentor" width="615" height="256">Vuka was shot in over two days in Kliptown, Soweto, and was in post-production for a week.Credits:Client – South African Breweries 18+ ‘Be The Mentor’Creative agency – Joe Public UnitedChief Creative Director – Xolisa DyeshanaExecutive Creative Director – Roanna WilliamsCreative Director – Markus BothaArt Director – Shalisha HiraCopywriter – Haydn CorkeDigital Copywriter – Inge Blignaut Account Director – Jeanne RosenbergTV Producer – Wendy BothaProduction House – Egg FilmsDirector - Zwelethu RadebeProducer - Saskia Rosenberg HaakCasting – Casting Initiative, Mandy SewellDirector of Photography – Fabian VettigerPost-Production – Post ModernEditor – William KalmerComposer and Arranger – Grant Booth
