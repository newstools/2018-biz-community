Event security goes further than merely providing a burly, suit-clad bouncer at the door. Professional security providers should offer vendor vetting, a detailed security plan, event security on the day, and project management at and leading up to the event. This entails orchestrating and implementing  the necessary expertise, to ensure a smooth, incident free event. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473610.jpg" alt="Jacki Condon, MD, Apache Security Services" width="312" height="208">Jacki Condon, MD, Apache Security ServicesThe first element to address is the vetting of vendors before any service level agreements are signed. According to Condon, this process is similar to that of screening a potential employee before making a hiring decision. “Businesses not only rely on vendors for a successful event, but they also usually provide them access to their property and their most valuable assets; their staff. It is essential that suppliers’ references are checked, their track record scrutinised, and their associates considered before signing on the dotted line. To do this effectively, expert assistance should be sought.” Now that vendors have been vetted, and the best selected, the next step in securing an event is to develop a sound security plan. “This plan must cover every aspect of the event, with in-depth forethought about all eventualities that could arise,” confirms Condon. “The plan should, at the very least, take the following into account: talent, player and artist security; security drivers; car park security; location security; VIP close protection officers (bodyguards); reaction units; stewards; doormen; human barriers; crowd management officers; access control; medical teams; and aerial surveillance and monitoring.” In measuring whether the security team delivered successfully, businesses should consider whether only invited guests were permitted access, if the crowd and logistics were managed to the client’s satisfaction, and whether the venue requirements were met. “The most important function of event security is to ensure guests feel safe and secure, and that a sufficient security presence is seen to deter the commission of a crime at the event,” concludes Condon. “With a good security plan in place, guests can relax knowing that both they and their property are safe. With the right vendors secured, the client can relax knowing that the event will run smoothly, and all threats have been anticipated and handled before they can arise. The result is a well-run event that will be remembered for all the right reasons.” For more information, please contact Jacki Condon: jcondon@apachesecurity.co.zabRev('brev-d69f3fd3-c065-4497-bb68-59cbd93c530a', '>a/\<az.oc.ytirucesehcapa@nodnocj>"az.oc.ytirucesehcapa;46#&nodnocj:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
