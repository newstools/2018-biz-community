So many times with mnemonics you have this great piece of music and picture and then you are jarred into hearing the bespoke mnemonic. It was so nice to be given the freedom to use the mnemonic in a musical way - just changing it slightly - but still identifying that it is the Maq mnemonic.For the first TVC, we hear various characters singing different lines of the song and culminating in the choir singing Let it shine - this seamlessly goes into the mnemonic.Authentic soundSince then Howard has created many variations on this single song and mnemonic, each time arranging the song to culminate in the mnemonic and matching the musical key and genre to the theme of the TVC.  We can really re-arrange the song in any style as long as we keep the melody line and harmony. On the next TVC, we went down the instrumental route using live Dixieland musicians - a solo trumpet to play the melody (that I played myself) a sousaphone and a banjo - to give it the real authentic sound.At the same time, I also composed a TVC for Maq fabric softener but this had to be completely different. This music had to be very soothing and we focused on a piano instrumental. This really highlights how we can have the same mnemonic but change it slightly to fit any music that comes before it.When creating the Maq Dishwashing Liquid TVC I wanted lots of bubbles and sparkles so the music had to have a really bouncy and light feel to it. This time the guitar sets the melody, again ending on the mnemonic.The brief for the latest Maq Auto washing powder TVC was for a glamorous, fashion shoot. I decided to move away from the usual melody and completely re-harmonise the song - using the same lyrics and rhythm but really turn it on its head. I’m really happy how this turned out and using the beautiful voice of Mariechan Luiters gave it the feel we needed.Learning curveBygate adds: "This has been a great learning-curve about how just one piece of music can be tweaked and re-arranged to fit any style of brand TVC and how the mnemonic is integral. Adam has been very clever musically, making the song and mnemonic fit over so many different briefs. "Since the campaign was launched, Maq has experienced unprecedented growth and research has shown that both the song and the mnemonic now have very strong associations with the brand. Maq washing powder is now the number two brand in the handwash category."
