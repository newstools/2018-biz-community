Nominated in the same category were fellow business leaders from South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya. “It is indeed a great honour to be nominated among such great and successful individuals. I am confident that this will motivate and remind young, black entrepreneurs all over South Africa that hard work coupled with Black Excellence truly pays off,” said Mr Zungu. Annelize Wepener, Chief Executive of CEO Global – the awards organisers, said that the intention of the various recognition awards is to honour the unsung heroes and heroines in Africa’s business landscape. She encouraged leaders to learn from their peers, listen to them, be inspired by them and take all the knowledge and skills that they have acquired and use them to invest in and build their own brands.
