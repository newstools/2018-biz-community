With this has come a new logo that places Africa ‘at the heart’ of Global Out of Home Media, illustrating the division’s passion for the continent. “The new look and feel builds on our legacy and heritage, but also offers a modern take on it, which complements the company as leaders in the out of home space,” says Howard Lonstein, Marketing Manager of Global Out of Home Media.  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473763.jpg" alt="Patrick de Robillard" width="300" height="448">Patrick de RobillardAnother important development has seen the appointment of experienced industry professional Patrick de Robillard as Global Out of Home Media’s Head of Sales. De Robillard has over 20 years’ experience in the industry and is a specialist in the African market.“This is a great opportunity,” says De Robillard. “I’m proud to be looking after such a highly-regarded brand and team and it’s great to be back at Global and working across Africa. I feel that Global Out of Home Media, together with PMG’s resources, forward-thinking and innovative approach, is going to be a serious force to be reckoned with in the next couple of years.”With years of experience across Africa, Global Out of Home Media offers advertisers insight and key in-market experience, making it seamless to advertise across the continent. Its knowledge of the African market, continued investment, particularly in Digital Out-of-Home, including its unique nuances and the dynamics of how to operate, puts Global Out of Home Media in the perfect position to deliver best-in-class service, sites and audiences. Ultimately, this means Global Out of Home Media is primed to service a host of multinational brands, media and creative agencies, in addition to the direct business it generates. It prides itself on delivering effective and results-driven campaigns, with a focus on service excellence and the leveraging of its position as an expert in the Africa market.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473764.jpg" alt="Global Out of Home Media rebrands for the future" width="620" height="413">Estimates show that by 2025, almost half of Africans will be living in cities. This has positioned the continent as a major investment market, which is helping to fuel the GDP growth of many African countries. This economic growth, together with media fragmentation, provides an ideal environment in which out of home media is able to play a role in providing a communication vehicle and access to sought after consumer sets. Effectively, the growth in urbanisation and investment will lead to an increase in commuter traffic and time exposed to Out-of-Home.Further to that, the business has taken a long-term view on Africa and recently demonstrated its commitment to the continent’s out of home industry by taking one of the leading sponsorships at the Airports Council International Africa’s 27th Annual General Assembly, Regional Conference and Exhibition, in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire in October. That commitment, coupled with the introduction of new opportunities and OOH innovations, means that Global Out of Home Media is in a position to provide agencies and multinationals with the opportunity to work with one company, and one that is able to deliver on their out-of-home communications requirements in key airport and roadside billboard locations across Africa.
