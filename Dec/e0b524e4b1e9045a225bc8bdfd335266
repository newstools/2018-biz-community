This was made clear by the 57% of South Africans who believe finance and banking brands are cutting edge. But, here’s where consumers get a bit fickle. Though they acknowledge they need and admire finance brands, at least 50% still profess to hate them. It’s enough to leave brands across the industry scratching their head, asking the question – ‘how did we get here?’The struggle to connectFor the longest time consumer perceptions of the finance industry have been shaped by rational drivers, such as necessity, innovation and intent to purchase. Unfortunately, this has meant the more emotional drivers, such as customer experience and social impact have taken a backseat. While this is starting to change, the year’s research shows financial service providers are still battling to create positive emotional connections with their clients.As an industry, finance now sits in the ‘provider’ quadrant of WE’s Motion Matrix, meaning it scores highly across rational drivers, but not as well when it comes to emotional drivers. This tells us that while South Africans know they require financial services, they aren’t always excited about them.It’s a scary position for brands to find themselves in, especially when one considers, that the industry - which has remained relatively unchallenged for many years - is about to be flooded with new competitors.No less than five potential disruptors are knocking on the door of the finance sector. It’s a formidable line-up, with contenders like Bank Zero, Discovery Bank, Postbank, Tyme Digital and African Bank vowing to shake things up. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1710/414982.jpg" alt="Discovery gets bank licence" width="120" height="120">Discovery gets bank licenceDiscovery Bank has become the second new bank to obtain a licence from SA's banking regulators as the market is opened to new competitors for the first time in almost two decades...By Hilary Joffe 17 Oct 2017Innovation is not a silver bulletAgainst this backdrop of escalating competition, innovation alone will no longer be enough.Finance companies now have to find a way of creating those emotional connections that have been so elusive until now. At the end of the day, it’s an emotional experience that creates memories, and positive memories that keep brands top of mind.But, thanks to the scandalous behaviour of several well-known finance companies, brands operating in the sector will find it more difficult to create positive connections with consumers than ever before.Consumers are less tolerant than ever beforeThe reputational crisis that has been brewing in the auditing profession has done a good job of tarnishing the industry as a whole. Over the past couple of years, the auditing sector has been embroiled in several looting sagas. From KPMG to Steinhoff and the Venda Building Society, the list of unethical auditors caught with their hands dirty in these major scandals just seems to keep getting longer.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437017-120x120.jpg?2" alt="KPMG under the cosh again over VBS Bank" width="120" height="120">KPMG under the cosh again over VBS BankEmbattled audit firm KPMG South Africa has announced that two of its partners have resigned, rather than face disciplinary charges for failure to disclose their financial interests in VBS Mutual Bank...16 Apr 2018<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/431018-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Jaco Pretorius, CEO: Ensimini Financial Services" width="120" height="120">The Steinhoff saga: Who are the biggest losers?Only time will tell whether Steinhoff shareholders will be able to recover any of the losses that they have suffered...27 Feb 2018The public is becoming progressively intolerant of this kind of behaviour. In fact, 66% of South Africans would actively join in the public shaming of a banking or finance company if it was openly under attack.It also doesn’t help that consumers have always had a somewhat negative view of financial service fees. Though it’s a misperception, customers believe that banking fees in South Africa are particularly high. The situation is made worse by the fact that banking fee structures can be complex and confusing, creating further mistrust among consumers.Authentic connections start with credibilityIt’s clear that in order to create more emotional connections with consumers, brands first need to grow their trust.And gaining trust is about more than simply adhering to honest and open communication. Instead, it’s about making sure the customer feels they are the brand’s priority.A major part of this involves keeping promises that have been made. A high degree of responsiveness is equally important - customers feel a positive connection with brands when they are eager to engage at every possible opportunity.At the end of the day, financial service providers need to ask themselves what kind of emotion their brand should be evoking and then find ways of incorporating that sentiment across all of the company’s various touch points.While this may all sound simple, the tough part lies is remaining consistent throughout each and every interaction.As they say, trust is earned. And if brands in the finance sector want to ‘uncomplicate’ their relationship with South African consumers, they’ll have to win over their trust through some good old-fashioned dependability.
