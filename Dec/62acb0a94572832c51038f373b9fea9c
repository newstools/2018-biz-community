<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/474129.jpg" alt="Tractor Outdoor and UrbanSigns announce strategic partnership" width="520" height="98">“We are proud to join forces with Urban Signs,” says Ben Harris, Rights and Development Director at Tractor Outdoor. "With DOOH growing rapidly in the OOH sector there is no doubt that we as media owner need to evolve and keep up with the latest trends within the industry. By collaborating we are merging our large-scale portfolios and expertise to allow our clients to target multiple key locations specifically aimed at their target market and maximising their unique reach.” An exclusive digital 3x6 screen which is located along the M5 highway in Cape Town is one of the first DOOH additions to the “urbantrac” trademark. With the addition of this screen, it now takes Tractor’s digital portfolio growth up to nine screens this year alone. "It is my pleasure to announce that UrbanSigns and Tractor are now a fully formed partnership. We have together put in a tremendous amount of hard work and I am confident in Tractor’s expertise and knowledge of the OOH industry and I look forward to future developments," says Antony Urbaniak, owner of UrbanSigns.
