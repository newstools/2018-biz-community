He’s family! What started as a brief introduction and a comedy set at CEO, John Paul’s birthday celebration, turned into a professional MC gig that led to another and then another and as they say – the rest is history. Not only did he quickly win the hearts of our team but he’s no stranger to our clients either. Mpho’s wealth of ‘behind the scenes’ experience with events and the advertising/creative space brings added value to our team and maximises new opportunities for our clients.Behind every successful entertainer and go getter, we’d like to think that there is a powerhouse spurring them on and while Tumi Mohale takes on the title of being Mpho’s manager through her company Sweet Life Management, she wears an entrepreneurial hat and is known as an influencer.
