Within hours #headlessman was trending in South Africa. This was followed up with a ‘reveal’ video, which showed that #headlessman was a stunt done by Debonairs Pizza in the fun spirit of Halloween.“#headlessman allowed Debonairs Pizza to enter the Halloween conversation on social media in a way that’s organic and palatable for those in its target market who utilise the media often,” said FCB Joburg’s Creative Director Mbeu ‘Snooze’ Kambuwa.“It was a proactive idea, and I’m so pleased the client said ‘yes’. Not only were the results in terms of numbers really good, the conversations around Debonairs Pizza in the chosen media are exactly what we hoped would be sparked.“In total, #headlessman was viewed 151,714 times in 48 hours with 2,156 shares and 3,945 likes. Not bad for a brand that has a stronger traditional media presence versus digital,” he quipped.Credits:Creative agency: FCB                Business Unit Director: Mogani NaidooAccount Director: Kefilwe KhandaAccount Executive: Kaylyn NaickerChief Creative Officer: Ahmed TillyCreative Director: Mbeu Snooze Kambuwa          Copywriter: Mbeu Snooze Kambuwa & Stefan SchutteArt director: Nicola BowerDigital creative strategist: Kyle Duckitt   Traffic Manager: Theresa Selema                       TV production: Nakita Bolus & Mun-ying De Lacy                                   Media planners: Jarred Mailer Lyons                   Production companies: FCB Joburg                   Directors: Mbeu Snooze Kambuwa, Stefan Schutte & Kyle Duckitt                      Editor: FCB Joburg
