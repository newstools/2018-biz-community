With 2018 being a challenging year for most and the only way to survive such arid times would be to take on everything with strength and tenacity in order to survive. This year our theme was inspired by the determination of the “succulent plant”. Each winning team member was awarded a succulent plant as their gift for being part of a successful team. The company also received an Award Jar filled with tasty treats for everybody. The floating trophies have now been making its rounds for 10 years recognising those amazing teams.
