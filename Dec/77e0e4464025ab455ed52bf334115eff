We felt strongly that, although risky, if we held up a mirror to our own denialism around drinking and driving, it might be the most effective way to start to change behaviour..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why did you decide to go the social media route in allowing the campaign to be defined by the audience?We knew that social media allowed us to actively and immediately involve our audience, giving them the power to define the campaign. We needed to be prepared for all the reactions we might have received, but the many sleepless nights of anticipation and preparation were worth it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was/is the objective?The primary objective is to inspire people to change their own behaviour and take personal responsibility, rather than comment on society at large. The campaign launch, however, was just the beginning of the campaign. The follow-up phase helps to reinforce the conversation and educate people around drinking and driving/walking along with ways to change behaviour. Messaging appears everywhere from shebeens and taverns to widespread OOH, online and traditional media..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has the response been?The response has been phenomenal. The campaign was trending no.1 in SA on Twitter on the first day of the campaign. Our launch was televised live on eNCA, and later covered on SABC news, 702, Soweto TV, News24 and many other broadcasts and online channels. Most gratifying has been the response on social media indicating that the campaign has been well understood and prompted some to ‘re-think’..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next?We now move into phase two of our campaign, which will see much media support invested in spreading our ‘Re-think’ education message.Anything you’d like to add?It is always exciting when you are doing important work for a cause, which affects all of us, and you are able to track sentiment and engage reactions immediately. It has been a true demonstration of our mission statement – to create brand experiences people want to spend time with. Working with a tight, motivated team internally, alongside a brave and trusting client, have been additional bonuses.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
