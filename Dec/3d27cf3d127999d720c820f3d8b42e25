Since 1990, the Financial Mail Adfocus Awards have grown to become a much-anticipated event in South African marketing and communications industry. The awards celebrate SA’s leading advertising agencies, and recognise those individuals making the biggest impact on the industry. This award is a significant accolade for Vizeum who were up against a considerable list of finalists including PHD, Carat, The Media Shop and OMD. Tanya Schreuder, Group Managing Director of the Dentsu Aegis Media Brands, stated: “In 2017, Vizeum had two of its biggest client wins since inception, Telkom and ABInbev, which further scaled the agency. Retention is key to future-proof and we value our long-term partnerships and of the support from our clients who have been with us since inception. The Vizeum DNA lies entrenched in its people who drive the vision of accelerating business growth through media. Winning an award once is always a feather in one’s cap, receiving the accolade twice, says that Vizeum is consistently living up the promise of bringing idea-driven solutions, that transform media from a numbers game to being a game-changer.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/474711.jpg" alt="Vizeum SA wins Financial Mail Adfocus Network Media Agency of the Year" width="625" height="469">“I'm immensely proud of the team behind Vizeum’s success, the stellar people whose commitment and hard work we rely upon to deliver the results yet at the same time maintain our vision and culture.
