According to OFM General Manager, Nick Efstathiou, the 12 Days of Goodness initiative is an important way OFM can give back to its community.“Letter to Santa and Wingz of Change both aim to change lives. For many of our listeners, Christmas is not a happy time. There are no gifts under the tree, no lavish Christmas lunch and nothing to look forward to. Hopefully, we can bring joy to these listeners and make this Christmas special.”Make your Christmas wish come true with a chance to win any gift your heart desires from a participating Checkers store. Identify a gift or item you would like to see underneath your Christmas tree, write a letter to Santa asking for the gift on the stationary provided in the Checkers store, post it in the entry box and tune in to OFM from 3 to 14 December to find out if you are a winner! Entries for this competition close on 13 December.Many listeners received a much-needed helping hand from the Just Plain Drive feature, Wingz of Change, this year. From 3 to 14 December, Wingz of Change will become a daily feature and will hopefully make Christmas a little more joyful for those in need.  To enter, send an e-mail describing your or someone else’s Christmas wish and stand a chance to win a share of R60,000, courtesy of One Sure. The e-mail address is wingz@ofm.co.zabRev('brev-7b661632-53b4-4d32-9bda-ee14fac0d2c5', '>a/\<az.oc.mfo@zgniw>"az.oc.mfo;46#&zgniw:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
