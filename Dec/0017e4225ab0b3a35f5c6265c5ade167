Where do you live, work and play?I work and live in Brand Cartel’s office, on the roof of Bryanston Shopping Centre. In my free time, I play with the dogs, which also live in our office.

What’s your claim to fame? I can lick my elbow. Other than that, I’m a pretty good cook.3. Describe your career so far. Starting Brand Cartel at the age of 23 with no experience in agency life was either very brave or very dumb – I’m still not sure which. The first three to four years were extremely tough, not only from a financial perspective but from stress and mental health perspectives, too.

Since then, we have been growing from strength to strength.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. A good joke, trustworthy people, and a glass of wine at the end of the day.5. What do you love about your industry? Marketing is one of the most technical and scientific business processes, in my opinion. Getting it wrong can be devastating, but getting it right can be oh-so-rewarding. Being an agency allows us to consult and learn from multiple wins and losses simultaneously, across multiple industries and platforms.

It’s not for the faint hearted, but for easily bored, adrenaline junkies it’s absolutely thrilling. 6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. I’m a bit of a Jack of all trades, so it’s hard to pin one activity down. It’s usually a jumble of brainstorms, client “problem-solving” meetings, tracking the performance of campaigns, developing strategies and playing with our resident Boston terrier and pug.

A post shared by  Brand Cartel (@thebrandcartel) on Jul 19, 2018 at 7:00am PDT 7. What are the tools of your trade? I studied business management, law and economics but eight years down the line, I would say it’s actually people skills, mixed with search engine optimisation, digital advertising platforms and website user experience – and my trusty MacBook.8. Who is getting it right in your industry? It’s a tough question because the industry is so broad, and many brands are winning in different ways.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1703/383649-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Insurance rivals go head-to-head in aid of charity" width="120" height="120">Insurance rivals go head-to-head in aid of charityThe King Price family arrived to work this morning to find an empty throne – their king (mascot) has been abducted by one of its (green with envy) competitors over the weekend...13 Mar 2017I would say King Price is doing a great job from a humour angle, Virgin Active Red from a positioning perspective and FNB from a customer experience perspective.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. The one mistake brands do make is misunderstanding who their customers are, or what they want. Making one of these mistakes means that the basis of their marketing strategy is misdirected, at a fundamental level. Often agencies would rather appease the client by running with a flawed campaign than to risk damaging the relationship by telling the client that they are wrong.10. What are you working on right now? Personally, we’re launching a number of websites and the ensuing “go-to-market” strategies.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? Either while working out or in the shower, it’s 50/50.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I have a great card trick, after a few tequilas I have also been known to do ‘the worm’.

What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?
