We celebrated Yanga’s announcement with a special festive performance by the trio, and will continue to support the Cape’s winning melodic trinity through their music careers.” “I was completely overwhelmed by celebrating the announcement in song with my idols, Craig Lucas and Paxton. I am beyond excited about being added to the impressive line-up for Huawei KDay. This will be my first big performance in the city and look forward to meeting all the Capetonians who rooted for me during the Idols competition,” said Yanga Sobetwa. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/474809-625x135.jpg" alt="2018 Idols winner, Yanga, added to Huawei KDay line-up" width="625" height="135">|Tickets are priced from R300 for adults while children under the age of 12 will pay R150.
