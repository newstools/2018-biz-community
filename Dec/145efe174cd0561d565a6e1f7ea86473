Not even #BlackPanther could touch it.Broadcasting issues topped the biggest news stories of the year too.

The #Sona2018, delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa, was the most talked about political moment in South Africa in 2018.Finally, because South Africa loves sport, the #WorldCup was the most talked about sporting event of the year, and the most shared hashtag in the country in 2018.
