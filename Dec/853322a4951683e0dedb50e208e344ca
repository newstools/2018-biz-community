It tracks impressions that can actually be seen by users and helps advertisers understand the Opportunity to See (OTS) performance of each ad placement – in essence it measures whether consumers are actually seeing ads.The IAB qualifies a display ad impression as viewable if 50% or more of the advert’s pixels appear in the viewable space of an in-focus browser tab for at least one second post render.“Viewability is one of the most logical of metrics, and one of the most important when it comes to campaign success,” says Craig Nicholson, Regional Sales Director, Joburg at The SpaceStation. “There have been numerous studies done that have shown an inarguable link between viewability, CTRs and the material impact on offline store visits and conversions. While viewability is not a reflection of an ad’s effect or engagement, it is all about whether the consumer has been given the opportunity to see the ad – an essential factor in a campaign’s success.”The SpaceStation’s viewability rating can be credited to a number of things like the nature of the platforms the company offers as well as the innovation and scale found through their campaigns.Adds Gavin Ruiters, The SpaceStation’s Regional Sales Director in Cape Town, “At the end of the day, advertisers want to see campaign results that show tangible conversions, in other words they want their ads to lead to sales. Our ad viewability results are allowing that to happen.”*Date range: Q3 2018For more information go to www.thespacestation.co.za or follow them on Twitter @SpaceStationZA.
