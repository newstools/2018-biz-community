The video features a song called ‘Oceans of Change’, lead by Sir Rod Stewart as a sea turtle, Thor “The Mountain” Bjornsson, Sarah Catherine Hook, a choir of people and various other animated marine animals injured by plastic parts. Together, in harmony, it calls on people to take responsibility and make the simple and meaningful life change of going reusable and acts as a metaphor for the green hills and blue oceans that have become littered by plastic waste.“I have a great love for our oceans and marine life and was happy to lend my voice and support to this campaign,” commented Stewart. “If it helps raise awareness and effect simple changes like switching to reusable bottles, then I’m honoured to be a part of it.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/474370.jpg" alt="Daniel Birnbaum" width="625" height="417">Daniel BirnbaumCEO Daniel Birnbaum said, “Plastic has become a pandemic threat with its impact upon human health still unknown, but with devastating environmental consequences to our oceans and marine life. In this campaign, we wanted to give a voice to marine animals and, together with them, encourage people and corporations to switch from single-use plastic to reusable packaging.“While one reusable SodaStream bottle can save thousands of single-use plastic bottles, the world needs to change more than just its drinking habits to combat the global pollution hazard. We should all do our best to shift away from single-use plastic including straws, cups, bags and bottles.“SodaStream hopes that this campaign will encourage many to make the change. It’s in our hands.”Birnbaum continues....bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was the brief/key insight? The key insight was to make consumers aware that single-use plastics are a danger to our oceanic environment and wildlife.

According to research, up to 80% of all litter in our oceans is made of plastic.At the rate at which we are dumping items, such as plastic bottles, bags, cups and straws after a single use, by 2050 we will have more plastics in the oceans than fish – Erik Solheim, head of United Nations EnvironmentThe demand for plastic has increased dramatically over the last 70 years. Half of the plastic is used only once and then disposed of, the remaining 86% ends up in the ocean, environment or landfills. Plastic pollution in the seas also impacts human beings like people who eat marine food. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How is SodaStream taking a stand on addressing this issue through this campaign? Plastic has become a pandemic threat with its impact upon human health still to be fully revealed. It has devastating environmental consequences to our oceans and marine life. In this campaign, we wanted to give a voice to marine animals, making them more relatable, and together with them encouraging people and corporations to switch from single-use plastic to reusable packaging..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who wrote the song, 'Ocean for Change', for the campaign?
