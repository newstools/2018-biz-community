Here's how SA companies are working for better work-life balance and pledging to transform for the better...By Leigh Andrews 3 Dec 2018To illustrate this, Pfluegl mentioned that Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has been popular since the 1940s, but the basic pyramid is outdated now, beyond the addition of ‘Wi-Fi’ and 'battery' at the base of the pyramid: An update by Tony Robbins in 2014 shows what’s now important for a happy life.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/473997.jpg" alt="Pfluegl explaining Maslow's hierarchy of needs." width="625" height="338">Pfluegl explaining Maslow's hierarchy of needs.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/473998-625x325.jpg" alt="Pfluegl explaining Tony Robbins' view on how human needs have changed." width="625" height="325">Pfluegl explaining Tony Robbins' view on how human needs have changed.Pfluegl spoke through each of these new needs ties in with the growing movement towards digital transformation across all industries.From Maslow to Robbins: The new human needsOn significance, she said it’s all about customisation and personalisation when dealing with consumers. In fact, a study shows that 86% of consumers feel a personalised user journey makes a difference.Pfluegl mentioned Amazon as a leader in this regard, adding that Spotify also does this well, in using the algorithm to predict other music you will like “it feels like they really know you.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/465986-120x120.jpg?2" alt="When AI meets your shopping experience it knows what you buy - and what you ought to buy" width="120" height="120">When AI meets your shopping experience it knows what you buy - and what you ought to buyWhether you do your shopping online or in store, your retail experience is the latest battleground for the AI and machine learning revolution...By Michael Milford and Gary Mortimer 29 Oct 2018<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/461685-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Spotify launches Afro Hub" width="120" height="120">Spotify launches Afro HubAs part of Spotify's newest Global Cultures initiative, designed to promote and bring to the surface culturally diverse music, Spotify today announced the launch of Afro Hub...5 Oct 2018Next is variety. It’s true that most of us are creatures of habit, but we also love having choice. The success of apps like Uber Eats is a testament to this.This seeming contradiction ties in with the next level of human need: On certainty, Pfluegl said we like surprises in our personal lives, but we also need to be able to make predictions and plan ahead.To illustrate the effectiveness of this in the business realm, Pfluegl spoke of Yoco. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/413312-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Yoco releases free POS solution for small businesses" width="120" height="120">Yoco releases free POS solution for small businessesPayments service provider Yoco has launched an enhanced POS solution, which is South Africa's first 100% locally made, free point of sale app...5 Oct 2017It’s a South African app that launched in 2015 with the idea that many small businesses needed a payment-management system that operates on phone or iPad, because so few consumers carry cash these days, yet payment software often proves too expensive for startups to implement.Pfluegl says the need for love and connection is a tricky one, as love and tech are constantly moving away from each other.That’s apart from the likes of improved tech for video calling and apps like Meetup, which link to your other social channels, bringing your connections from the online space to the offline real world.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1703/385813-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Truecaller, Google improve video calling" width="120" height="120">Truecaller, Google improve video callingTruecaller is stepping into a strategic agreement to integrate Google Duo, a high-quality video calling service, within its app.28 Mar 2017On the need for personal growth, Pfluegl says this links to the traditional ‘tip’ of Maslow’s human needs: self-actualisation. She spoke of her after-hours ‘side hustle’ work with Future Females in this regard – started by founders Cerina Bezuidenhout and Lauren Dallas, when they realised that just 2% of VC funding found its way to female-led companies.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/452952-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Future Females Cape Town team." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Celebrating the Future Females entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and side-hustlersIt's a Catch22 - you either have an idea to start a business, the motivation to do something different, or the skills to multitask, but it's rare for those magical elements to all sing loudly at the same time...By Leigh Andrews 20 Aug 2018Next is contribution: We all want to contribute, but it’s that much sweeter when we are rewarded for making a significant contribution.
