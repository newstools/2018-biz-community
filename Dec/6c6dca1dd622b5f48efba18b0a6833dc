The celebs who will be adding their voices to this meaningful campaign include musicians: Kyle Deutsch, Aewon Wolf and Holley Rey, actors TK (from Uzalo fame) and Madhushan Singh (Kandasamy’s) and comedians Carvin Goldstone and Jem Atkins, as well as Paralympian Tyrone Pillay and Mrs SA 2nd Princess Jo-Ann Barnwell. All the money collected will be directed to the greatest need at four identified schools: Jabulani primary, Maria Memorial primary, Mqhathi primary, Nqongqotho primary. From infrastructure to educational resources, fundraising will be focused on the area we believe will have the most sustainable impact. We envision the initiative playing a defining role in empowering young minds and equipping them with the necessary tools to become future leaders. East Coast Radio’s General Manager Boni Mchunu has urged people to open their wallets and hearts. “East Coast Radio’s Toy Story reminds us that we all have an important duty to play in ensuring the well-being of disadvantaged children in our country, particularly in KZN and it is also a reminder of the impact that our collective efforts can have on the lives of future generations.” To make a pledge on Toy Story Corporate Day call 087 086 94 95 between 6am and 6pm on Friday, 7 December. Toys donations can also be made at any Toys R Us & Babies R Us up until Friday. The toys that are donated through the campaign will again be distributed to disadvantaged children at government hospitals, children’s homes and orphanages.
