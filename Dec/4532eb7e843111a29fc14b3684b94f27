With Tony Granger set to retire, could you share some of your favourite memories of his work and impact on VML? Tony is a legend in the industry, not just in the network. It’s a huge inspiration to have a South African sitting in that global role, out of New York. That’s inspiring to look at from afar. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1703/385497-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Tony Granger, Y&amp;R's SA-born global CCO." width="120" height="120">#BrandManagerMonth: Resisting the usual with Y&R's Tony GrangerTony Granger, South African born and bred global CCO of Y&R Advertising, shares how the network resists the usual by focusing on local relevance while collaborating globally in real time...By Leigh Andrews 28 Mar 2017On the meetings and times I’ve shared with Tony, his love of concept and love of ideas is amazing. Many people become jaded or cynical as they rise higher up in the industry and get involved in the business side. He really loved and appreciated ideas.So it’s amazing to see someone stay true to the craft of ideas at that level..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Definitely. Talking about different levels, let’s focus on your new role as regional CCO for SA…In SA and Africa and the Middle East, we are trying to work out ways to work much tighter together, SA is a unique market and in the way we put VML and Y&R together, this market is a little ahead in terms of merging companies. It’s nice to have that behind us and not still have to work all of that out now, so we can focus on the work and our clients instead.Putting companies together is not as simple as just putting people in the room and hoping it all works out.So it’s nice that we’ve got through that and everyone knows their skillset, their strengths and weaknesses – so we can really start focusing on the creative product in SA as well as a regional level. I’ll be meeting more regularly with the global leadership team to improve our strategic, creative and executional product across the board.We talk a lot about creating connected brands, and that’s really what we aim to do. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/438382-120x120.jpg?1" alt="VML South Africa launches new positioning - 'Creating Connected Brands'" width="120" height="120">VML South Africa launches new positioning - 'Creating Connected Brands'NATIVE VML, Y&R South Africa, Labstore and NATIVE Media have combined their respective skill sets to create one fully integrated company called VML South Africa.Issued by VML South Africa 13 Mar 2018In doing that, we want to connect people as well, to connect more deeply to our clients as partners, and connect their brands to an audience.With the fragmented media world that we live in now, creating connected brands really works because every touchpoint with your consumer defines your brand. We’ve realised that orchestration is the new specialisation.We don’t think of a brand as a single monolithic entity anymore. A brand is a network of touchpoints… Experiences, events, adverts, products, digital, stores, and more. We aim to orchestrate ideas across this ‘network’ in a way that elevates every single touchpoint.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/429552-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Beth Wade, VML Global CMO." width="120" height="120">Native VML's new journey: Conducting the orchestraAs Native VML moves into a new era, the changes in the agency are not only organic; it is about a new business model that adds value and brings the customer into the brand's ecosystem. It is a new form of integration...By Danette Breitenbach 15 Feb 2018I want to be able to orchestrate ideas and stories, whether it’s films and entertainment or products and services or apps – whatever it is, to orchestrate great experiences to create these connected brands. And to do that across the region, and eventually with the global teams. The connected brand approach works so well for our clients in having a single strategic and creative partner that can think, execute, and orchestrate their needs, while deeply understanding their business problems. This really makes the work relevant and effective. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/466921-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Team VML South Africa, presenting at the Red &amp; Yellow School's #DigitalAgencyShowcase.
