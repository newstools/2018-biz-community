But that’s where the joy seemingly ends.On the face of it, the clip opens with Will Smith being Will Smith, features a shoehorned K-pop moment from BTS, a Fortnite homage, an ode to “In My Feelings”, and monologues focusing on 2018’s biggest political talking points.But just two hours after the video’s debut, the eight minute clip has amassed more than 220 000 dislikes, and 184 000 likes.(Almost) everyone hates YouTube Rewind 2018YouTube commenters — some 112 000 of them — were among the first to voice their disdain.“2017 is better even tho (sic) that one is bad as well,” read one comment.“If i remember correctly Ninja Is A Twitch Guy not YouTube,” poked another.“OK!! Am I the only one who doesn’t know half of them??” asked one user. And yeah, I was largely thinking the same thing.Over on Twitter, the official YouTube account received some flack from the community for neglecting PewDiePie — the site’s most followed creator.(His chair, however, receives some screen time thanks to Jaiden).Well subscribe to the legend @pewdiepie (I hope he sees this tho)— Jean Gregory (@Jeaansereano_) December 6, 2018Where’s PewDiePie? He’s literally you’re biggest— Bucky Vanderwall (@SheepxBuzzard) December 6, 2018Others called it how they saw it.“No demonitization, no Ali-a intro, no pewds vs t-series? Horrible YouTube rewind, not to mention there was absolutely no rhythm whatsoever,” tweeted one user.No demonitization, no Ali-a intro, no pewds vs t-series? Horrible YouTube rewind, not to mention there was absolutely no rhythm whatsoever— spurs for zion (@caleb_crites) December 6, 2018That was the shittest rewind ever— Kai prescod (@Kaiprescod1) December 6, 2018While one user highlighted the irony of Ninja’s appearance.Youtube 2018... linking to twitch streamers while banning youtubers for linking to twitch.— Natural Healthy CBD (@CbdHealthy) December 6, 2018On the r/YouTube subreddit, conversation was more measured.The sentiment remained the same though.“Definitely the worst rewind of all time,” wrote one Redditor.“Alot of huge events weren’t addressed, alot of large content creators weren’t featured (sic). But the worst part is that they painted it as ‘our’ rewind, but didn’t include people the vast majority wanted.”“Every second was worst than the last,” wrote another.But one user, in particular, summed the video up rather succinctly: “Remember when youtube rewind was good?”
