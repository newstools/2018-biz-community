The result? A flame-grilled work of art for the Big King™ campaign. The mural was unveiled at Sneaker LAB in Braamfontein on 6 December during the cultural experience of First Thursdays. Abrahams completed a portion of the mural in front of event-goers on the evening to showcase his technique and land Burger King®’s flame-grilled message. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/474569-625x353.jpg" alt="Russell Abrahams (Yay Abe) adds fire, with Burger King South Africa" width="625" height="353">Ezelna Jones, Group Marketing Executive at Burger King® SA, explains that for the past 64 years, Burger King has been flame-grilling its legendary beef burgers. “Flames give our burgers its iconic taste and we wanted to explore different ways to communicate the art of flame-grilling. Partnering with Russell helped do this in a memorable and engaging way.” Burger King® SA approached Abrahams with the concept. The brief was simple – to create something beautiful that incorporated the element of fire. Jones adds, “It was important for us that whatever Russell decided to create, it captured his unique style. We didn’t want to be too prescriptive in what the result should look like.” <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/474570-625x415.jpg" alt="Russell Abrahams (Yay Abe) adds fire, with Burger King South Africa" width="625" height="415">“It was certainly the first time I have been asked to create art with flames," laughs Abrahams. “But, I am always looking for new ways to develop my craft with new techniques and textures. It was great having the freedom to try something new.” In addition to the mural, Abrahams also starred in Burger King® SA’s latest television commercial, alongside his brother, Gary Abrahams. He also created a limited-edition Big King™ box for BK guests to ensure everyone could have a piece of his art. Abrahams adds, “I am really proud of the work we have created, and I’ve had so much fun on this campaign.” To view the making of the mural, visit this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C18lQK0sosk.
