In what is becoming a bit of a regular tradition, Just Design Jhb and Cadbury teamed up again this year to create yet another limited edition collection of chocolate goodies. This year we opted for packing with a secondary function – Christmas decorations! Meet the half-built snowman, Santa’s lost reindeer, the brave polar bear and Santa himself (obvs). These beautiful characters were created to house bite-size chocolate slabs – in baubles – that can then be used as decorations on Christmas trees! The idea is that every year Cadbury will release a new festive, seasonal theme, complete with new baubles for collection. Packaging that performs a secondary function and can be reused, is becoming a massive trend worldwide as we all become more conscious of waste and its impact on the planet. These baubles (and their future counterparts) will live on for long after the chocolate contents have been eaten, and will hopefully become part of the annual decorating ritual. They say that the original ‘Father Christmas’ was in fact green and white, but Coca-Cola’s prolific marketing resulted in the red version that we all know today. Perhaps it’s time for a purple version as Cadbury starts to dominate the aisles?We would like to wish all of our fans a wonderful break over the festive season and will catch you all in 2019!<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/474008.jpg" alt="Deck the halls with bells and baubles..." width="500" height="125">About Just DesignFor over 19 years, Just Design has proven time and again that good thinking leads to great creative.
