What’s remarkable is that at no point during the commercial did anyone mention their preference for Nike. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/458308-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How Nike inspires others to 'just do it' with commodity activism" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How Nike inspires others to 'just do it' with commodity activismWhat do Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams and Caster Semenya have in common?

They didn't talk about the soles, the weight, the structure, the quality. But they sold the hell out of those shoes. That’s the raw power of hitching the brandwagon to customers' beliefs, feelings and aspirations rather than competing on features or price. Know your customers' aspirations, values, their languageIt's not a new concept at all – Steve Jobs decades ago was tying the Apple brand to consumer emotions. Even today, when many electronics' brands have significantly narrowed the quality and features gap between their own products and that of Apple, there are still crowds sleeping in front of iStores when a new model launches. The marketing (and the product) has made us feel something when we’re holding the latest iPhone in our hands that we simply don't feel with other brands.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1603/333631-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What would Steve Jobs do?" width="120" height="120">What would Steve Jobs do?I'm one of those people who prefers not to replace stuff just because someone tells me it is time to do so.

Diving into such an intensely politicised space was a risk for Nike but one that the brand was willing to take. They are not only generated a ton of free publicity but for every person who burned their Nikes, there were others positively drawn to the brand.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/456611-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nike's courageous new ad campaign mixing racial politics with sport will be vindicated" width="120" height="120">Nike's courageous new ad campaign mixing racial politics with sport will be vindicatedNike stirred up controversy on Monday when it unveiled its 'Just Do It: 30th anniversary' advertising campaign.

If you’re going to sell your brand based on your customers' feelings, you have to understand them intimately. You have to know their aspirations, values, their language. You have to move closer to them. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1704/387205-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Andrey Armyagov -" width="120" height="120">Pepsi drops ad accused of mocking 'Black Lives' protestsNEW YORK - Pepsi said on Wednesday it was dropping an ad featuring the supermodel Kendall Jenner that appeared to use the "Black Lives Matter" protests to promote the soda brand...6 Apr 2017You have to start by listening to your customers carefully. Finding out how they relate to your brand both functionally and emotionally. Then you need to make sure that everything you do with your product works for them. Know what you stand forIt’s vital that you know what you stand for and what your values are. And to make sure every single employee knows, respects and implements their job according to those values. There can't be any gaps. You have to make sure your intrinsic and extrinsic marketing elements match up. You can't simply tell customers how to feel, you have to engineer it by making sure that all elements – from the branding to the website to the signatures - match the promises and design of your above-the-line marketing. Lastly, you have to deliver. Too many brands promote their ethics and values and are left red-faced when some of their actions that are contrary to their values are exposed in public. If a customer ties an emotion to your brand, they’re much more loyal and less likely to switch due to functional factors like price increases or shifts in the market. So brands can play on customers’ emotions but they should never overplay their hand.
