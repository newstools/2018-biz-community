Gigantic and gourmet, our pre-packed basket was more than enough for the two of us, with each ‘course’ individually packed and locally sourced. You can put together your own picnic from the goodies in the deli area, if you prefer.

From 8:30pm every night until the 31st of January, you can take a walk through 18 artworks that light up after dark. It’s such an amazing exhibition and I highly recommend arriving early for some dinner at Eight Restaurant or a picnic under the trees before winding your way through this stunning show!

These artworks of light go above and beyond into the realm of theatre by incorporating light and sound. There’s an element of movement too, as you follow the action around the grounds - you're encouraged to stay with the pack, but everything's so intriguing there are bound to be a few stragglers and adventurers on their own mission. Wander in wonder on a starry, starry nightNo quick half-hour sky show, Pather said:Some of the works are whimsical and flitting, ironic; some may be glimpsed at from a distance and in passing, some will require more time and interaction. These experiences – of walking and pausing, catching a glimpse or settling down to absorb – invite us to be introspective, adventurous and playful in turn.Absorb they did, with attendees wandering up to the likes of In die sterre geskryf  (Written in the stars) by Berco Wilsenach in wonder. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/474071.jpg" alt="Written in the Stars - Berco Wilsenach.

Exhibited outside for the first time, it’s an artistic investigation into different decoding systems to map and explain the night sky to a visually impaired audience, complete with panels lit from within to look like ‘endless space’. The panels are lit from within, creating an effect of thousands of dots floating in midair.
