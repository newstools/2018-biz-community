Hamiltons In Creative Company was responsible for all the elements of the campaign, including the very emotive and heartwarming television commercial, which was shot by the in-house production crew.This year, Food Lover’s Market has added a whole bunch of delicious food items, including gourmet roasts and luxury baked goods to the festive offering. The idea behind the campaign was that when you saw all this mouthwatering food, you just wouldn’t be able to resist taking it all home with you. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475065.jpg" alt="Food Lover's Market celebrates the festive season with new campaign and a cookbook" width="600" height="390" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475066.jpg" alt="Food Lover's Market celebrates the festive season with new campaign and a cookbook" width="600" height="382" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475067.jpg" alt="Food Lover's Market celebrates the festive season with new campaign and a cookbook" width="600" height="385" align="center">We wanted a heartwarming story that people could relate to, to get them in the festive spirit and inform them about our new range.For the television commercial, we translated our ‘Too good to resist’ concept into a fun story about Santa delivering gifts on Christmas Eve, just to be tempted by a Festive spread featuring all the items from our brand-new festive range. After overindulging in the decadent feast, Santa then falls asleep and fails to deliver the rest of his gifts. When the kids wake up on Christmas morning, they are at first flabbergasted that there are no gifts under the tree, but then they see Santa snoring on the couch and they are overjoyed..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you hope people get out of these ads?We were aiming to create awareness that Food Lover’s Market has launched a new Christmas range and that it's the ultimate Christmas destination this festive season..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Where did the idea for the cookbook come from?Brian Coppin, CEO of Food Lover’s Market, wanted to give something back to the loyal Food Lover’s Market customers who have supported us throughout the years.
