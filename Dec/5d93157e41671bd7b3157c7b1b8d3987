The results were sometimes surprising and served to enforce the idea that readers’ interests often range across titles.“I was a bit surprised [by the results of the quiz] but it was interesting to see the associations and reader interests of each publication brought to life,” said Himraj. “The Sunday Sundaes experience showed me that the readers of the Sunday papers are quite divers and more affluent than I had perceived. I also didn’t realise how big the Sunday market is, and what their interests were, but now I do.”When asked what insights from the Sunday Sundaes campaign had stuck out for her, Himraj replied “That the publications reach 4.1-million readers, and that digital and print are very strong channels we can use.” Remember to follow Ads24 @Ads24_News.Follow Ads24:<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473486.jpg" alt="Ads24 Sunday Sundaes: A winning campaign" width="30" height="30"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473487.jpg" alt="Ads24 Sunday Sundaes: A winning campaign" width="30" height="30"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473488.jpg" alt="Ads24 Sunday Sundaes: A winning campaign" width="30" height="30"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/473489.jpg" alt="Ads24 Sunday Sundaes: A winning campaign" width="30" height="30">
