As an HR manager or recruitment specialist, when you go through the CVs of applicants for marketing positions and see a candidate who has digital marketing skills and/or qualifications on their resumé you need to jump at this candidate. This is because they have the right mindset needed to function in a digital world.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1812/472453-625x388.jpg" alt="Why a digital marketing certification will make a CV stand out" width="625" height="388">Retailers are migrating to online shopsBricks-and-mortar retail outlets are moving towards setting up online shops in addition to their physical establishments. The reason for this is that they are trying to cater for a broader spectrum of clients and their preferred retail habits. In order to make these online stores succeed, marketers need to reach potential customers where they choose to be online. To function effectively in the digital space, marketers need to be very sure what demographic they are targeting online as well as what their online habits are. Marketers need to know if their target audience spends their online time on Facebook for example, and they have to have the agility to quickly change their marketing plan should their target audience decide to switch to another platform. Marketers also need to be aware of the keywords potential customers would search for and ensure that these are included on their digital platforms ensuring they are visible to their audience. SEO skills are therefore very vital.Online learning in an IoT worldOver the last couple of years, the popularity of online learning has skyrocketed. The main reason for this is the flexibility that it offers – especially for students who already have jobs and are pursuing further studies to further their job prospects.Most marketers who are classically trained will already be entrenched in their marketing careers. They will see the need to reach people digitally but will not be able to afford the time that it takes to become full-time students again. This makes online learning, where they can upskill themselves in terms of digital marketing, very attractive as they will be able to pursue a quality education while, at the same time, holding down a job.Having a candidate with an online qualification on their CV should also ring bells for recruiters. Studying something online takes great dedication on the part of the student. So, if they complete the qualification and, do well, you can be sure that this candidate will be great in any job that you place them in.The Digital School of Marketing is an online provider of accredited digital marketing education.
