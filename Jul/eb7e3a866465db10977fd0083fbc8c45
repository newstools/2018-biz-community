So if a mobile user searched for your site, what would they find?How ready is your website for mobile users?A website that works well on computers, or even tablets, does not mean optimal user experience when on mobile phones. Especially with so many screen sizes. A simple trick for anyone that is planning on developing a new website, or revamping their existing website, is to use a mobile optimised or responsive theme when using a platform such as Wordpress. Wordpress makes creating a new website easy and with the vast list of expertly crafted themes available, you don't need to be a computer programmer or a tech genius to get a professional, fully functional, mobile friendly website going in a snap. This is increasingly important these days, because when your website is not mobile friendly, Google will be less inclined to show it in searches, and even limit your ads to people using their mobile phones. How to win friends and increase Google search rankingYou need to remember that Google’s primary goal is to help it’s users find the information that is most relevant to them. If they didn’t do that, people would start to use other search engines. Part of helping users find the relevant information is also about how easily and effectively users can consume and understand the info. According to their own statistics, 40% of online smartphone users will be less likely to come back to a mobile site if it does not quickly satisfy their needs. So if your website isn’t mobile friendly, takes too long to open on a mobile device, the buttons are too small to click making it difficult to navigate, and users are bouncing away and leaving it as soon as they get there, Google will take note and rather not suggest your site.
