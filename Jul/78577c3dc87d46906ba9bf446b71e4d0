The blanket collection drive is an extension of a project started during 16 Days For Youth* with the help of McDonalds, where boxes were placed across the province in various stores as a means to collect blankets and issue to those in need. The team will be spending the evening outside of the Green Point McDonalds broadcasting from 3pm with the #Drive326 team throughout the night up until #HeartBreakfast. Members of the public who would like to join are welcome to do so and would need to bring a blanket as a means of donation. The aim is to secure as many blankets as possible which will be distributed to various areas where most needed. For more on 16 Days For Youth and beneficiaries, please visit www.16daysforyouth.com
