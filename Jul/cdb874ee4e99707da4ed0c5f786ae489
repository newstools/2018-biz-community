Image provided.Taking place at the Orms Cape Town School of Photography, Orms pro broadcast sales manager Juanne Whyte took a full seminar room of professionals, amateurs, bloggers, and those generally interested in all things tech, through this new and innovative technology that will enable users to create their vision and imaginative ideas in the most dynamic and creative way. Guiding us through the very technical presentation (perhaps just for me), Whyte introduced us to the DJI Ronin-S, the newest handheld camera gimbal to join the DJI family. First one in SAA post shared by  Juanne Whyte (@juannewhyte) on Jun 29, 2018 at 9:14am PDTThree-axis motorised gimbal stabiliserThe three-axis motorised gimbal stabiliser holds both mirrorless and DSLR cameras, with an offset roll motor for screen visibility, and he demonstrated briefly how the innovative framework elevates camera payload above the roll axis, making the camera's built-in display obstruction free and always in your line of sight. In addition to providing an unobstructed view, the angled roll motor allows for more space to balance bulkier setups.Whyte said that operating the Ronin-S is easy and intuitive to setup with Auto-Tune directly on the gimbal for optimal torque control. Powerful, high torque motors actively stabilise your shot when mounted to moving platforms at speeds of up to 75kph.It allows the user to focus better on one’s subject with the easy-to-control Focus Wheel. When a compatible camera system connects to the Ronin-S, one can pull focus via the included cable. An optional external motor can also be added, bringing broader compatibility to all lens types while enhancing precision control.Ergonomic designThe ergonomic design of the Ronin-S frees unwanted shake when shifting from underslung to an upright position in one smooth take, and the detachable design offers numerous usage scenarios. This is done through mounting it to an RC buggy for low-to-the-ground tracking shots or letting it act as a stabilised remote head when attached to a jib. This detachment feature also makes it more convenient for easy storage.Lastly, the Ronin-S includes a suite of automated features within the DJI Ronin app, letting you produce even more creative professional footage to unlock your true filmmaking potential. We were then joined by hip-hop group the Ubuntu B-Boys, who entertained us with their impressive breakdancing moves, while those who wanted to give the Ronin-S a go could fiddle around with it, panning around the group, to get an idea of how the innovative gimbal felt and worked.
