An award is afforded to entrants who demonstrate success in both strategic and creative spheres of a campaign. The awards are a testament to creativity’s power to a business’s bottom line, with winners being able to directly correlate campaign success to commercial client results. As a challenger financial services firm, 10x Investments’ effort at creating awareness in an industry that sees them largely outspent by competitors was lauded. The content-led campaign utilised nothing more than a simple, but immensely impactful, video series to show, rather than tell, what was happening to people’s investments in a manner they could relate to. The result was an 228% year-on-year increase in brand awareness and 55% decrease in cost per client acquisition. CEO of 10X Investments Steven Nathan notes, “At 10X we are building something that customers will love to buy, not something brokers will love to sell.” South Africans responded positively to 10X’s message and the brand’s partnership with M&C Saatchi Abel Cape Town and their bold, brave creative thinking led to strong brand awareness and tangible company growth, making 10X Investment’s first Apex Award win well deserved. Led by the agency’s mantra of "brutal simplicity of thought", Founding Partner: Head of Strategy Robert Grace noted. “As an agency, we strive to create beautifully simple solutions in an increasingly complex world. 10x being a challenger brand allowed us the opportunity to bring this to life using robust thinking and brutal simplicity to highlight the message in a lighthearted, impactful and honest way. We’re really pleased with not only the creative, but the effect that the campaign has had on their bottom line.” For more on the #StopDaylightRobbery campaign visit: www.mcsaatchiabel.co.za/work/nik_siv.
