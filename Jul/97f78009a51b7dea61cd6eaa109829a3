That you only commission services from home-grown, local companies if you can’t afford the overseas guys. (Or if it's a tender requirement.) Importing servicesIn the brand development and expression game we see this all the time. Whether it be research, strategy, identity design or communication, the ‘big guys’ are often importing the services of agencies from the UK, Europe and/or The States, at mammoth cost, and with often lacklustre results.In 2007 Pick n Pay made a fairly minor update to its identity – a refresh, modernisation of the 40-year-old logo. No problem with that (yes, it garnered its fair share of negative reaction and debate), but the South African branding industry was aghast to learn that it had spent two years working on the change – with the London office of global firm, Landor. And reportedly for a fee of R25m.  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/0711/11467-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Fresh new look for iconic Pick n Pay brand" width="120" height="120">Fresh new look for iconic Pick n Pay brandOne of South Africa's oldest and best loved brands, Pick n Pay, this morning, Monday, 12 November 2007, announced a total brand transformation – from new logo and colours, to in-store signage, uniforms, new brand lines, new media and advertising – in a dramatic visual feast of new signage and brand elements at its head office in Cape Town. In fact, the entire new brand essence has been driven by its customers, as is evidenced in the new brand line: ‘Inspired by You'.By Louise Marsland 12 Nov 2007With some of the most talented strategic and creative minds residing here (Cape Town is the Design Capital of the world, after all), did they really lack faith in any one of our great local agencies to produce an acceptable result? There is a plethora of examples of globally-trading home-grown South African brands with award-winning, globally-acclaimed identities that have been created by home-grown South African agencies (including us).  25% tax in the billSo – we place heavy import duties in certain industry sectors for the purpose of protecting local businesses. Why not also on services? Surely, we should be saying to South African brands; “By all means, go shopping for your rebrand outside of our borders, but there will be a 25% tax on the bill you receive, which will be used to create educational opportunities for our great, aspiring talent.”  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1702/377784.jpg" alt="South African agencies offer big international brands local flavour" width="120" height="120">South African agencies offer big international brands local flavourDespite globalisation, every country has its quirks, lingo and languages that must be spoken in the right way to attract the right people. South Africa is no different...2 Feb 2017It’s already significantly more expensive to buy these services in from these countries – that would make it all the more pricey. And perhaps we would see more results that are truly relevant and reflective of the unique South African culture and environment because they would instead be created by South Africans.
