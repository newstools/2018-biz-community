Despite having secured bursaries for a number of students, there are still around 7500 academically deserving students at UKZN that remain unfunded. East Coast Radio will broadcasting live from the UKZN’s Westville campus from 6am till 3pm on Mandela Day to encourage the people of the province to give generously in the spirit of Nelson Mandela. The station’s General Manager Boni Mchunu has urged people to make a donation, “By supporting the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s bursary fund you can give the gift of knowledge and help change the future of a young person in our province. When qualified they can go on to shape a brighter future for KZN and its people. We feel strongly that education is the key to effecting change and we’d love to see the people of KZN get behind this initiative.”Executive Director of the University of KwaZulu-Natal Foundation, Professor Anesh Maniraj Singh explains, “The UKZN Foundation relies on businesses, trusts and foundations to support our bursary scheme. However, these donors also have other initiatives and institutions that they support which depletes their resources. We are therefore calling on individuals to help us.”Singh adds, “If every ECR listener donated just R67 we could potentially raise enough money to provide 800 full bursaries. I appeal to every listener to dig deep and donate at least R67 as their contribution to developing the next generation of leaders.”  For more information or to make a donation visit ecr.co.za
