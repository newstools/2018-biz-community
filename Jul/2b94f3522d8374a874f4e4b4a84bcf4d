Part of the pitch win includes overseeing the launch of the global Malibu Games platform in SA.  Mike Silver, Elevator CEO, said, “Elevator is incredibly excited to partner with such an iconic brand like Malibu. We see huge potential in the SA market for the brand, arguably the sleeping giant in the rum category.” The pitch was Elevator’s first major win since receiving investment from the Smollan Group in April. According to Silver, “With our recent new partners, we decided to go after this pitch a little differently. Being able to leverage off of the Smollan Group assets as well as their incredible retail IP played a valuable role in our ideation and strategy process." Grant Hendricks, Rums Brand Manager at Pernod Ricard SA, said that “Elevator managed to combine integrated creative thinking with commercial know how to deliver a compelling pitch. Their chemistry too with ourselves and our partner agencies we believe will lay a powerful and colloborative platform for Malibu to win in the SA market.” About Elevator: Elevator, in partnership with Smollan, is a data-driven insights lead BTL agency that creates measurable impact for some of SA leading brands.
