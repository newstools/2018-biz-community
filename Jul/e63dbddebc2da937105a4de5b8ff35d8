Although the teams who worked together on this pitch were from different agencies, markets and areas of speciality – they believed firmly that by joining forces they would produce creative and thought-provoking work that would truly benefit the client in a meaningful way and help Sunlight achieve its €1 Billion Goal. Currently Sunlight is the second-largest FMCG brand in Africa, after Coca-Cola. Sue Napier expressed, “This pitch truly saw the best, most experienced and talented minds within the WPP group, coming together in a spirit of collaboration and partnership, to solve a very complex challenge for the Sunlight brand in Africa. It was the 'un-agency' pitch, where we set aside our expected competitive mindsets as individual agencies within the Group, to work together to answer a bigger need than our own. "It was an inspiration to work side by side with the best that WPP has to offer. As a result, we were able to demonstrate not only the breadth and depth of WPP’s capability and experience, but also the depth and extent of our insight into the African continent.” South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana markets will be the first priorities, with more regions to follow in due course. Keep on the lookout for the big idea which will be rolling out soon, updates to follow.
