Deschamps’ Le Bleus worked their way up to the World Cup Final in Moscow last night where they went head-to-head with Croatia for what was “one of the most exciting finals in FIFA World Cup history.” Given that it was France’s Independence Day, or Bastille Day on Saturday, we can say that the nation had a pretty good weekend. What did social media have to say about it?<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449216.jpg" alt="Sunday, 15 July 2018: France leads in goals on the field and mentions on social media" width="565" height="342">Global media intelligence company, Meltwater, analysed social media mentions and trends surrounding the World Cup. In the week leading up to the final, 7 – 14 July, there was 1,5 million mentions of “France.” In the same week, “Croatia” was mentioned 998,000 times on social media.
