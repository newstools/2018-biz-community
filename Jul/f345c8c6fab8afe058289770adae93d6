It starts off no different from plenty we saw in the tournament. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/447809.jpg" alt="The Cape Town TV ad that has the soccer world rolling with laughter" width="120" height="120">The Cape Town TV ad that has the soccer world rolling with laughterA television commercial developed in Cape Town has become one of the most globally shared pieces of video connected to football in the past three weeks...Issued by Ogilvy & Mather 5 Jul 2018But then, it goes on and on. As fans and TV crews chase the player’s agonised writhings, he keeps spinning over and over… out of the stadium, into the surrounding city. On and on until finally, he rolls into a KFC outlet.Suddenly, he is cured. He has “made a meal of it” – both on the pitch and off.And that slogan – “Make a meal of it” – was the hashtag for fans to communicate with KFC every time they saw some outrageous diving and players making a meal of it in their over-acting.It’s humorous, it speaks to phenomenon everyone has been talking about, and it works to emphasise how far you would go to get the great taste of KFC.So it gets an Orchid from me.The Onion for World Cup ads, though, must go to Hyundai and Maroon 5. It’s not that I don’t like the product, or that the ad doesn’t accurately showcase features of the company’s product. The problem is not just that we can’t get those products yet in SA… but it is the fact that, repeated over and over, ad nauseum, Maroon 5’s song, Three Little Birds (Everything’s gonna be alright…) eventually becomes painful, like having a tooth drilled.For violating one of the Golden Rules of Advertising – don’t push anything past its natural pain threshold or sell-by date – Hyundai gets an Onion.We have, in this country, a group of superheroes, the mere appearance of whom will cure all of our ills. They are called politicians… and at least they seem to believe that seeing their attractive (not) mugs on newspaper ads, on TV and on roadside billboards, will sort out everything from Aids to poor school results.Doesn’t appear to be working, people, at least going by the popularity of our new national symbols – the barricade and the burning tyre…Yet perhaps the most pathetic one I have seen was down in KwaZulu-Natal recently, – and may I preface this was saying in all humility (in case His Majesty is listening), I have nothing against Zulus: They are by far the most interesting people who have threatened to kill me.On a number of the byways I love to take when I am down in The Kingdom, I saw repeated pictures of one Willies Mchunu, who is now Premier, but was once MEC for Transport. These images were adorning posters urging people to think about road safety.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1404/191546-120x120.jpg" alt="KZN's Easter road safety campaign" width="120" height="120">KZN's Easter road safety campaignSharp focus will fall on road safety in KwaZulu-Natal as the country prepares for the upcoming Easter holiday this weekend.15 Apr 2014Point one: using a poster on the side of a road (which can easily cause a driver to be distracted from the job at hand) to promote road safety is not too clever. One would have thought that Mchunu, in his previous life of MEC for Transport, might have realised this. Never mind that these posters have clearly not been checked or replaced in the two or more years since he left the portfolio.Point two: What on earth does your face have to do with road safety? I am so sick and tired of the cult of ego among our politicians. It proves one thing with crystal clarity: public office is all about the politician and not the people.Yet another Onion.Imagine that money being spent on doing some actual good.
