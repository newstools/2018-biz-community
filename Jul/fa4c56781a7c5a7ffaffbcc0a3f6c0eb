A small town in the Wild Wild West, a place typically fraught with tension, but this time there is something very different. We see South African quirks play out in a Western setting by injecting a little bit of our saucy South Africa into the Wild West. And then placing a Chicken Licken® restaurant right in the centre of it all, starring and introducing Bootless Bandit Durango. Filmed once again by Peter Pohorsky from Plank Films, his directorship brings this South African spaghetti western to life to create a humorous and engaging film that draws the audience in. “We wanted to take uniquely South African issues and spin a positive light on them. By taking tensions points we all experience as South Africans and showing how the tension can dissipate when we all have inner peace, paralleling the unusual Western town with our own country,” says Xolisa Dyeshana, Chief Creative Officer, Joe Public. The integrated campaign launches peace by peace from 25 July including five short films and a dedicated website due to launch on 13 August, all of which culminate to a full-length film. Online, the brand invites you to taste ‘inner peace’ for yourself, within a Chicken Licken® Saloon. When you explore the Saloon you will experience tantalising sound bites, stories from our Bootless Bandit Durango and much more. So giddy up bamfwethus, welcome to the home of Rock My Soul Straight™!
