Where do you live, work and play?I live in a studio apartment in the heart of Cape Town, Green Point. I work about half a kilometre from my apartment, so get to walk to and from the office every day, a la NYC.  I play all over the city – from SUPing in Hout Bay to dancing on Loop Street.2. What’s your claim to fame?My parents are mates with Johnny Buckland, lead guitarist of Coldplay, as well as his wife and kids. So when Coldplay was in town, we got rock star treatment – backstage and after party passes. They came over for dinner and drinks and I visited their place in London when I was there.3. Describe your career so far.My career so far has been like flying down a highway at high speed, with the windows down and music on full blast. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/441856-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gleb TV © –" width="120" height="120">Social storytelling 101: Stop and sharpen your marketing axeOn Friday, 18 May 2018, Cape Town's marketing set descended on the Park Inn Radisson, for Meltwater's latest Biz Breakfast session with Treeshake's Dave Duarte on the art of social storytelling...By Leigh Andrews 24 May 2018It’s been the most exciting experience. It started with a bang, as my first day at Meltwater was exactly one week after my final exam at UCT. I’m still learning so many new things every day, I’m obsessed with the work I do, and I get to learn so much from the people I surround myself with every day. At Meltwater, it’s especially Wes Mathew, who I’m so grateful to have the opportunity to learn from, and at Future Females, it’s the amazing women I work with, who never fail to bewilder me with their intelligence, talent and determination.

Meltwater is heavily invested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we’re pioneers in using these technologies to help companies make better business decisions. The options seem endless with regards to what the future of tech holds. It’s an incredibly exciting space.At Future Females, we have our physical monthly events in each city, but other than that, we’re completely digitised. We have a rapidly expanding online community and our online resources all focus on educating and empowering.I love that we’re a global community, operating in cities all around Africa and the world. Again, it’s technology that is enabling global connection and collaboration. The tech industry is also continually evolving and developing, which inspires me – there’s never a dull moment.      brb going to change the world A post shared by  Philippa Dods (@philippadods) on Mar 26, 2018 at 7:16am PDT The thing I love most about being in the tech industry is that I get to be a part of the future.6.

Of the Fortune 500 companies, only 5 are women-owned. Last year, female entrepreneurs received just 2,5% of VC funding and globally, women own just 1% of the world’s wealth. We’re making some progress, but in the last two years, in more than 50% of countries, female participation in entrepreneurship declined. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/436985-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Addressing that gender equality pay gap, day by day" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Addressing that gender equality pay gap, day by dayIt was 'equal pay day' in the US on 10 April.
