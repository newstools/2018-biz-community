Five ways of using electronic mail marketing to increase salesThere are so many ways you can use emails to engage more customers as well as influence the growth of a business. These include: 1. Use of transaction online mailsThese are usually the emails that a person receives right after purchasing an item online. They typically are confirmations for the orders, notice of order shipment or a thank you for shopping. Since such emails are of interest to the customer, they have a very high open rate. These emails can thus be used to entice buyers to buy another item in the following ways: Attach products that are mostly purchased along with the items the buyer has just purchased.List the products that are similar to what the buyer has just bought. Create a discount or special offer in case the buyer wants to buy another item in the future.2. Welcome emails Several top brands in the country usually sent welcome or introduction electronic mails as soon as a person registers to be on their email list. These emails usually thank the individual for signing up and in some cases, offer a discount on their next purchase. Since the discounts are normally in the subject line, their open rate is high. Thus a company can use them to attract new customers and you should do your best to create a solid strategy that reduces email unsubscribers.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1208/109928-120x120.jpg" alt="Losing subscribers?
