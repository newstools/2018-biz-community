The latest Allan Gray TV campaign – for which Adam Howard composed the original music – won “Best Of Reel” from iDidTht Craft Awards for June 2018. We are proud to have been involved with this very special project. Listen out for the solo flugel horn which Adam performed for the piece... <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450332-625x471.jpg" alt="Howard Audio sounds out two new awards" width="625" height="471">http://www.ididthteditorial.com/ididtht-craft-awards-june-2018/ Adam was asked by Rob Roy Music and agency Havas to play flugel horn on a radio tribute to the late Bra Hugh Masekela. The tribute was commissioned from Record Company - Universal Music. Having known Bra Hugh personally, it was an emotionally charged session for all. The spot eventually picked up a Silver Lion at the Cannes Awards in June which we are all thrilled about. Congratulations to Rob and the whole team. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450333-625x374.jpg" alt="Howard Audio sounds out two new awards" width="625" height="374">Click here to hear the radio spot. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450334-625x426.jpg" alt="Adam at Rob Roy playing flugel horn in tribute to Bra Hugh Masekela" width="625" height="426">Adam at Rob Roy playing flugel horn in tribute to Bra Hugh Masekela
