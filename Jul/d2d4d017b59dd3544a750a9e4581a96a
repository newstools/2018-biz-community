FoodForward SA and Pick n Pay are partnering, with the goal of raising 1,000,000 meals. The national food drive will help stock FoodForward SA’s warehouses with staple foods during winter, ensuring that the 600 beneficiary organisations they serve can continue to provide warm meals to the 250,000 dependants daily. Companies and individuals are being encouraged to spend 67 minutes at the packing event taking place at Gallagher Convention Centre to sort and pack the donated groceries into food hampers for distribution to beneficiary organisations during winter.
