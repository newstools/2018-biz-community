<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450315.jpg" alt="Dentsu Aegis Network Kenya unlocks the power of consumer insights with CCS" width="179" height="180">The platform, known as the Consumer Connection System (CCS), is a consumer, lifestyle and product survey that is widely regarded as the most in-depth single source of media, marketing and consumer-targeting data globally. CCS is Dentsu Aegis Network’s proprietary integrated consumer insight, planning and buying suite, designed to feed communication strategy, and enhance tactical planning. Researchers engaged with 3,700 Kenyan respondents across the urban population, LSM 4+, aged 18 + to extract their daily interaction across 80+ Media touch points. CCS has been rolled out in South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana, and has been successfully used by several clients across these regions to drive more effective communication strategies, and deliver efficiencies in targeting and budgeting. Christopher Madison, CEO Dentsu Aegis Network Kenya, stated, “One of the most significant things we learned from CCS is that context really, really matters.” Byron John, Insights & Innovation Director Dentsu Aegis Network SSA, said, “Having a tool like CCS in Kenya will put Dentsu Aegis Kenya streets ahead of their peers in the market. Not only is it now the most sophisticated media communications planning tool in Kenya, but it has inherently future-proofed Dentsu Aegis against any changes in the media research landscape for some time to come. The CCS Planner has the ability to calibrate, not only the CCS Benchmark data but any other third-party media data.” CCS is unique, in that it not only addresses the media reach dimension of consumer behaviour, but covers the reaction to this reach through an investigation into their notice and engagement experiences with different types of ads, ad formats and categories. It measures the usage, influence and effect on the consumer. Unlike other syndicated research studies, the key output of the CCS data is the foundation into Dentsu Aegis Network’s advanced communications planning tool called CCS Planner. With a powerful data source like CCS, a convergence planning discipline, plus an experienced and passionate team – this launch will certainly give Dentsu Aegis Kenya a clearer view of the consumer landscape in Kenya, allowing them to navigate the media landscape using the best research tool available to help their clients and their brands increase their bottom line.
