Last mile delivery is still a challenge, but with the innovations around ‘click and collect’ and the expansion of locker programs, I believe this can be solved. Payment has also been a barrier as we have a much lower rate of credit card penetration and a higher demand for COD. These issues are not insurmountable and we have the unique ability to leapfrog more established markets with innovative solutions. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Has Cape Union Mart Group experienced a significant shift to mobile over the last five years? <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449283.jpg" alt="Amanda Herson" width="300" height="385">Amanda HersonAbsolutely! We have seen a huge uptake in mobile traffic and mobile conversion. Currently, mobile comprises more than 50% of our traffic. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think are the most notable ways that mobile phones are impacting purchasing/shopper behaviour?Everyone can comparison shop all day and every day and have access to almost any item they want from anywhere in the world. If you don’t have the best product, at the best price, with the best service… you don’t really stand a chance. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}To what extent should South African retailers be prioritising mobile in their e-commerce strategy?I believe that you have to be ‘mobile first’ and everything else follows from there. Being ‘mobile first’ also ensures you have the simplest and cleanest design and functionality. The assumption is that the majority of your consumers are browsing on mobile. Of course, your desktop experience still needs to be exceptional and this is where there is an opportunity to expand features and provide even more in-depth information or choice. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/448939-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#MobileCommerce: The growth of mobile shopping in South Africa" width="120" height="120">#MobileCommerce: The growth of mobile shopping in South AfricaE-commerce is going from strength to strength in South Africa, more and more consumers are gaining confidence in making online purchases that are not solely limited to the likes of books, CDs, electronics, airline tickets and the like...By Graham Du Plessis 13 Jul 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Do you think South African fashion retailers are cracking omnichannel retail at present? If not, what do you think could be improved upon?I am impressed with the strides that South African retailers have taken. The opportunity lies in the back-end, in truly having a single view of the customer across all touchpoints and in fully integrating across all channels. The experience should be seamless regardless of how your consumer chooses to cross channels. This thinking applies to customer service, vouchers and overall experience. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Mobile shopping apps… a worthwhile investment at the moment, or not?Not for us. I believe it makes sense for very frequent purchases or ‘re-orders’. We would rather invest in the best-in-class mobile site. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1703/384702-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#SeamlessAfrica: Tackling the omnichannel retail reality" width="120" height="120">#SeamlessAfrica: Tackling the omnichannel retail reality‘Omnichannel' is not merely a business buzzword, it's the new retail reality.

We really don’t mind which channel you choose to shop in. You should be able to research any item you are looking for, find the information you are looking for, and purchase it wherever is most convenient for you. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any final thoughts on the opportunities that mobile can offer local retailers?Mobile allows you to offer the right product, to the right customer at the right time (and hopefully at the right price). This is a unique opportunity and with the advances in AI and a desire to truly understand the customer, I believe the future is exciting!Visit our Mobile Commerce special section for further insights throughout the month of July.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
