The creative spirits were very high and inspiring and we absorbed everything that we could from contacts to information and creativity. This time, the pressure was increased because we were no longer facing talents from South Africa, but the other winners from all over the world. We did not solely take this as a challenge but also an opportunity to learn from them, which will not only help us by broadening our horizons but also being able to share our experiences with them.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450763.jpg" alt="#CannesLions2018: Don't underestimate how big and life-changing this opportunity is" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1807/450764.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="580" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450765.jpg" alt="#CannesLions2018: Don't underestimate how big and life-changing this opportunity is" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1807/450766.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="948" data-lheight="600" class="gflipper-image" align="center">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Take us through what you experienced at Creative Week and what stood out for you?Due to a few hiccups in the film competition, Prince and I got to enjoy the first two days of the festival. We attended workshops and meetups where we got to discuss and participate in certain topics, meeting different people along the way.A big highlight, of course, was speaker David Droga from Droga5, talking about his journey and what he had learnt in his career. It was definitely a huge eye-opener for us as beginners in the advertising industry.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/448297-120x120.jpg?2" alt="David Droga © ." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2019: David Droga announced as speakerAdvertising legend, David Droga, founder and chairman of Droga5, has been announced as one of the speakers at the 2019 Design Indaba...By Juanita Pienaar 10 Jul 2018Undoubtedly, the most fun experience was the Facebook Beach.

It’s definitely true what they say – creatives do know how to party!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What were some of your favourite campaigns at the Festival and why?By attending the award shows, we were constantly inspired by work such as the Trash Isles campaign, Lacoste’s Save Our Species campaign and a lot of the work that won in the Health & Wellness category. As Prince is inspired by design and art direction, the 2018 McDonald’s out of home campaign was also a highlight. This simple yet perfectly executed campaign stood out strongly to him:.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice do you have for future candidates and young creatives who want to enter the Young Lions competition?One thing we would advise for future candidates is not to underestimate how big and life-changing this opportunity is. Words cannot explain how fulfilled, energised and excited one feels after not only attending the Cannes Lions Festival but even submitting your very own work. Don’t miss out on an opportunity like this, just because you’re not sure whether you’re going to win overall. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by entering.
