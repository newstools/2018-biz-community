It used a reworked version of ‘Amagugu Alelizwe’, a well-known, traditional South African hymn sung at funerals, to show that you don’t have to mourn the loss of your cellphone. “The idea was to juxtaposed the sombre nature of the song with fun lyrics about how our different characters came to lose their cellphones. Each spot represents a different aspect covered by Cell C’s C Surance,” explained 1886 Chief Creative Officer, Stuart Stobbs. “When it was launched, the campaign received many positive reviews; so we extended the campaign. And we’re excited with how it has been received by audiences. “And our showing at Cannes proved the Cannes judges loved it too. ‘iGugu Lebo’, ‘iGugu Nomsa’ and ‘iGugu Siya’ did us proud. Thanks again to Cell C for believing in great work.” Listen to the three new radio ads here:Credits: Client: Cell CCreative agency: 1886 Advertising, an FCB Africa agencyChief Creative Officer: Stuart StobbsCreative Director: Warwick RautenbachCopywriter: Ruby FourieProduction house: Rob Roy
