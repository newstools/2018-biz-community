Some of the warnings mentioned were Amazon's imminent domination and the ever-growing number of freelancers. He proposed that a new model of agency is being demanded. Agency 3.0 is the agency of the future where retainers are replaced with projects; value is quoted up front instead of hours and 40% of the work is done remotely. Micheal treated everybody to his take on technology disruptions, innovation and customers, all mixed with a healthy dose of good humour with his presentation “Simplifying Innovation in a World of Fast Constant Change”. A memorable take away for all was to keep asking yourself – what job does your customer hire you to do?About Digital SwarmDigital Swarm is an event founded by DigitLab and was created to fuel the growth of the digital marketing industry in South Africa. The concept of Digital Swarm is based on the notion of ‘swarm mentality’ and how people are influenced to follow the movement of the next person, collectively. This is why Digital Swarm is important in the fast-evolving industry of digital marketing. It allows industry leaders to share their ideas and knowledge and take the lead in transforming digital marketing. Others swarm to these innovative ideas and connect with each other to collectively accelerate the growth of the industry.
