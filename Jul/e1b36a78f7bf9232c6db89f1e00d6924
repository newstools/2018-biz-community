Both of these campaigns used location targeting – the backbone behind this totally captive platform. Telkom focused on coastal and holiday locations, with MTN targeting a more urban stay-cation audience. Key to the success of both campaigns was that ATM Media was viewed as in integrated part of the media plan and not an afterthought. Simon Allenburg, who managed both campaigns, comments: “Both campaigns had ATL support with the actual ATM being the final touchpoint. ATMs based on their location and the fact that they are points of purchase for many data deals make them the ideal communication platform.” Reporting and campaign data is critical for clients to determine ROI on their activity. With the assistance of all the involved banking partners, ATM Media was able to reach in excess of five million consumers, in a highly captive environment, who were simply a click away from purchasing data. Guerrilla have secured a number of big brands that will be joining the ATM revolution in Q3 of this year, with FMCG and medical clients leading the charge. Brands within these sectors are working with Guerrilla IMC to gain access to their retail, forecourt and medical ATM networks, allowing them to target consumers at the point of purchase.
