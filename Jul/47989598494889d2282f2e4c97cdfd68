Who wants to spend unnecessary time and money at the doctor, when the pharmaceutical industry provides so many shelf-ready cure-alls? Citro-Soda has been a South African household staple for years – used predominanty for the treatment of UTIs. But did you know that Citro-Soda can be used as a complete antacid solution? Well, neither did consumers... The brief was simple – inject new vitality into the Citro-Soda packs by modernising, improving shelf standout and counteracting me-too competitors encroaching on the brand’s visual assets. In addition, medical terminology was swapped out for consumer friendly explanations that really drive the benefits home. The resulting new look is bold, more premium and easy to adapt for future range extensions and formats. Citro-Soda’s shelf presence is stronger than ever, and it maintains its dominance over the fixture.
