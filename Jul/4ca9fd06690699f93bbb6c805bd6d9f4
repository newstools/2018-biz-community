In the Change category, Ogilvy won silver for the Cadbury P.S 2.0 campaign and bronze for the Neurobion Marketing the Unmarketable campaign. In total, Ogilvy won two silver and three bronze awards, making them the most awarded agency for effectiveness, on an evening where King James secured the only gold award presented, for their Sanlam Uk’Shona Kwelanga campaign. “We’re extremely honoured to be recognised by the Apex judges, because the adjudication process is so stringent,” said Neo Makhele, Head of Strategy for Ogilvy SA. “Entrants have to prove their campaigns contribute to their clients’ bottom line. Our five awards are an acknowledgement of Ogilvy’s constant focus on putting client needs first.” The Apex Awards recognise both strategic and creative effectiveness, and are presented by the Association for Communication and Advertising (ACA), the official representative body for the communications and advertising profession in South Africa.
