The focus of the awards was highlighting the need for business in South Africa (in this case black business) to be sustainable, committed to positively influencing the communities they operate within and creating jobs. Multi-Media contributes to the Black Umbrellas incubation programme on a monthly basis; it was, therefore, a logical step to sponsor the technical elements for the organisations' premiere awards ceremony. As a company founded and run by individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit, Multi-Media has 27 years experience in providing eventing technical solutions that excite, engage and create unforgettable experiences. The winners on the night were:  Overall Winner – Debar Ceramics (Pty) Ltd  Highest Number of Jobs Created – Debar Ceramics (Pty) Ltd  Incubator of the year – Lephalale Incubator  Best Performing Company – Modi Mining CC  Black Umbrellas Ambassador – HSE Matters We would like to congratulate all winners on their superb achievements. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in South Africa, highlights the fact that government is no longer the sole enterprise responsible for the promotion and implementation of actions that contribute towards promoting social and community interests. It is Multi-Media’s view - that it is not just good business practice to contribute to these initiatives, but, that it should be a determining factor on whether you choose to do business with any company. Multi-Media looks forward to a continued relationship with Black Umbrellas and contributing towards the development of SMEs and the fostering of an entrepreneurial spirit in South Africa.
