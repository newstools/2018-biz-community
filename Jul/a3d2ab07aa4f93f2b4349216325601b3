<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449282-625x417.jpg" alt="Enterprises UP partakes in first Gauteng township film academy" width="625" height="417">The brainchild of Thato Molamu, famed South African actor and entrepreneur, the academy aims to train creative and passionate young filmmakers between the ages of 18 and 35 as the first-ever township film academy in Gauteng. The academy will specifically benefit young people from financially disadvantaged backgrounds within the Tshwane municipality, Hammanskraal, Soshanguve and other surrounding areas. From these areas, selected individuals will be given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain valuable work experience through a well-crafted and fully funded 12-month programme. “We want to curb township social ills by giving talented young film entrepreneurs with creative minds the skills, resources and funding they need to succeed. My reason for partnering with the South African Creative Incubator is because I simply love the idea of creating the township film economy,” Molamu stated. “It creates opportunities for youth to tell their own stories, create their own content, and become sustainable businesses. Young people need access and a support system, and our goal and belief at [the academy] is normalising access.” During the course of the programme, selected filmmakers will receive tuition in film and video production theory as well as practical instruction on productions, with access to industry professionals. They will also be exposed to on-set environments and shoots via the academy’s industry partnerships. The business side of film will be emphasised through focused entrepreneurship modules that are taught throughout the programme by Enterprises UP and they will receive a certificate from the University of Pretoria (UP) upon completion. The film and video part of the training is also SETA-accredited. The academy is branded as proudly being designed for the township by the township, and also makes a point of accommodating capable filmmakers who might be physically challenged. "It’s a people-based initiative. We need to see the work that you have done, we need to see that you have committed to do something,” Molamu explained seeking a solution to empower young people with skills so they can drive their own economic progress. The first intake of 100 young filmmakers will commence in September 2018 and will be selected through a number of selection phases that will take place over the following few months. .kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px solid red; font-size:12px;}Visit our website to see more on our collaborative research and advisory services and for more information about our wide range of training programmes and short courses.Read more about this initiative here: https://goo.gl/9ypsLh.
