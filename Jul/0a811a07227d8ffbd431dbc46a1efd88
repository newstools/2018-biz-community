On 30 July 2018, Red & Yellow will launch a truly revolutionary, blended-learning Entrepreneurship in Action 10-week online course. A course specifically designed to give young entrepreneurs and small business owners the tools and insights they need to build sustainable businesses and become employers in their communities. For every deserving student sponsored, Red & Yellow will match it with another. “This Mandela Day Challenge is not a quick fix; it is a powerful step in the direction of sustainable and uplifting transformation,” comments Karen Hidden, the highly qualified and industry-experienced course lecturer. A small dent of R12,500 per student in your skills development, enterprise and supplier development or corporate social responsibility budget can have a massive impact on this country. The full amount can be claimed for B-BBEE purposes. Apart from the obvious reward of igniting change, sponsors will receive additional value from media coverage and acknowledgment on marketing collateral.  “It is no longer enough to just give 67 minutes; South Africans need to do more if there is going to be a meaningful change,” says Wesley Fredericks, Managing Director of Red & Yellow. “Being in the education industry, I can say with confidence that Mandela was right - education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world.”  For more information or take action, visit Red & Yellow’s website or email Andrew Allison at andrew.allison@redandyellow.co.zabRev('brev-07074b93-8d58-43a4-a45f-0e9b61eea2c3', '>a/\<az.oc.wolleydnader@nosilla.werdna>"az.oc.wolleydnader;46#&nosilla.werdna:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
