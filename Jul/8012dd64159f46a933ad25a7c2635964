So, we created a campaign that would not only meet those requirements but would also inspire people to take action. We are very excited to be a part of this campaign, that turns the traditional way of thinking on its head. The CliffCentral team are incredible content curators and with the upward trend in podcasting, creating this with CliffCentral was a no-brainer," says United Stations account executive, Zaza Bronkhorst. The campaign kicks off on Tuesdays during the Gareth Cliff Show, where the team refuses to turn a blind eye to current affairs. They naturally weave in Taylor Blinds content, providing some fascinating insight. On Thursdays, Lerato Tshabalala delves into architecture, decor and interior design during her show known as Living it Up With Lerato, where she engages renowned architects, interior decorators and space planners, who will focus on interesting aspects of interior design such as:Bedroom Talk - Setting the Mood by creating a Sexy SpaceFrom Nursery to Toddler - Evolving Kids SpacesSleep vs Light - Which Blinds Are RightJust the Two of Us - How to Mesh Each Other’s Tastes When Moving InIt’s A Woman’s World - How to Create Feminine SpacesIt’s Not Small… Its Quaint! - Decor Made for Small SpacesThe campaign is boosted with influencer posts and an extensive digital campaign. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/448603.jpg" alt="CliffCentral and United Stations create a winning authentic content campaign for Taylor Blinds &amp; Shutters" width="312" height="313">“Taylor have always chosen to market themselves differently: purposefully removing themselves from the clutter, making sure their messaging is communicated organically and authentically, whilst focussing on educating the customer. We’ve fortunately been successful with our strategy to date.  Content creation is key in today’s marketing arena and CliffCentral are leaders in this category. They’ve set the benchmark in digital radio and podcasting and have an extremely high quality of curatorship. Taylor take pride in selecting partners that share the same mindset as them: Quality, Trust and Innovation. We are thrilled to be working with the dynamic team at CliffCentral and look forward to an exciting relationship ahead,” says Kate Mederer, Taylor marketing manager. "We’re delighted to welcome Taylor Blinds and Shutters to the growing community of brands who are breaking through the clutter by creating content with us through conversations that are organic, entertaining and interesting. While still highlighting product features, a direct connection can be made with the audience by sharing information that adds value to their daily living,” says Gareth Cliff, founder of CliffCentral.com. As with generic radio, podcasting allows for generic advertising and sponsored content, however what digital audio offers above analogue is undoubtedly the ability to dynamically insert content. Podcast listeners are personalising their experience entirely, they're choosing what they get to consume, as if they're their own "Netflix of Audio". Podcasters are straight up electing to play and listen to a show or series, and the content provided needs to be engaging, which is exactly what CliffCentral delivers. There's a huge amount of 'blue ocean' for brands in this space and with the medium growing exponentially the time has never been better to join the Podcast revolution.Visit cliffcentral.com or download the app for more information.
