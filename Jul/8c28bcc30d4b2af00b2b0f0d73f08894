New Ogilvy Group MD Gallarelli was instrumental in driving the agency’s Next Chapter journey during his five years as MD at Ogilvy Cape Town, implementing a more agile business model that removes duplication and addresses clients’ broader business needs.

He has been a member of the Ogilvy Holding Board since 2016.    New Ogilvy Cape Town MD Vicki Buys has long been responsible for Ogilvy’s iconic relationship with Volkswagen SA. The 2016 Volkswagen Uber Up! Campaign she worked on won a Gold Loerie for marketing effectiveness – the first time the award was presented.

Buys has served as Managing Partner and Deputy Managing Director at Ogilvy, and has been a board member since 2013. She has also worked closely with Gallarelli to shape and implement the agency’s Next Chapter philosophy.   New Head of Delivery Tassin Albertyn comes to Ogilvy from Old Mutual, where she was Lead Digital Project/Program Manager and responsible for managing project stakeholders, digital operations, and project and programme planning, among other disciplines.
