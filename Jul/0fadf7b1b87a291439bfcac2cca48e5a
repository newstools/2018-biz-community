You watch,  We do the work,” the company sassily explains.“We know how annoying it can be to go through all your apps and delete files you no longer need; we also understand that when it comes to Netflix, the faster you can get to the next episode you want to watch, the better.”Users can choose to switch Smart Downloads on or off in the app too, and episodes will only download when the device is connected to WiFi.Of course, a download scheduler would’ve also been appreciated in the app, but there’s no indication Netflix is working on a similar solution.The feature is only available on Android for now.
