Platforms like Instagram have a community with a potentially high buying intent, because they’ve already discovered something they like - which they then may want to buy.According to Instagram, more than 80% of their users follow a business, so it makes sense that companies would use the platform to sell product. It is all about changing the business model of the brand – with community at the centre. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449813-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#MobileCommerce: From search to checkout, the top 5 features likely to make your user tap &amp;quot;buy now&amp;quot;" width="120" height="120">#MobileCommerce: From search to checkout, the top 5 features likely to make your user tap "buy now"Mobile, and increasingly apps, are core to the success of any retailer's strategy through all stages of the path to purchase or shopping customer's experience...By Lynette Hundermark 20 Jul 2018In the last few years, brands have seen increasing engagement from their customers, who use social platforms to express both their positive and negative sentiments about these brands. The most successful e-commerce brands are seeking not just to grab attention, but to join the conversation and be relevant and present where their (target) customers are. The most successful businesses harness this understanding to evoke a genuine feeling of connectedness and closeness between buyer and brand, as a strategy to increase sales through social commerce. Brand-building opportunitiesBoth Instagram and Facebook present unique opportunities for brand building and staying in front of users who scroll through their feeds daily. Social channels are designed for interaction, expression, and, most importantly, to create connections. The exponential rise in engagement across social networks has made the arena increasingly difficult to navigate. In order to build brand loyalty and enhance existing customer retention strategies, brands must identify new opportunities to isolate their market on social channels, creatively convert visitors into buyers, and devise customer engagement strategies to implement after the initial purchase. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/450885-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#MobileCommerce: E-commerce starts to connect with South African consumers" width="120" height="120">#MobileCommerce: E-commerce starts to connect with South African consumersWith the rise of e-commerce in South Africa taking some bold steps during the last few weeks with the merger of Superbalist and Spree, it seems that mobile e-commerce may finally be on a path to reaching its full potential...By Gareth Paterson 24 Jul 2018In the fashion industry in particular, Instagram is the primary source of inspiration for both content creators and consumers. In South Africa, Spree has seen an increase of 63% growth in Instagram users (91% on the SpreeMan account) and noted a shift from Facebook to Instagram and Twitter as SA consumers prefer the platforms for narrating experiences and expressing opinions and brand sentiment.
