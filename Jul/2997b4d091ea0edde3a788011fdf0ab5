He joined the agency in October 2017 as client service director and client lead on Mazda and lead the pitch team on OLX – a brand the agency is proudly delivering exceptional work on. “I consider myself a brand storyteller, a thought leader, a creative and corporate entrepreneur. Having been trained in media and entertainment business management, I have a varied cross-disciplinary background. My new role at BRFC will see these skills being brought to the fore on a daily basis. My focus, in addition to motivating a team of talented, creative people, is going to be delivering work that not only sets our clients apart from their competitors, but also increasing their brand awareness in new target markets.”Trevor has been fixated on the idea of uncapped growth, mainly because he has experienced the opposite in advertising agencies. “We seem to reward people for the years they’ve spent solving problems and not how quickly they can solve those problems. In retrospect we seem to be punishing fast learners. I want to build an agency that will reward and recognise people at their level of performance and not years of experience.”Before joining Black River FC, Trevor was the business unit director on Windhoek Beer looking after Namibia and South Africa. And prior to that he held positions in Ogilvy and Mather Johannesburg and served as Chief Executive Officer at The Creative Chapel Advertising where, under his leadership, the agency grew to R6 - 12 million in annual billings with anchor clients such as GloCell Mobile, City of Tshwane, Nike, Nestle, Peroni Draught beer and Aveng Group. Trevor has worked on clients like Mazda South Africa, GSK, Siemens, Vodacom, BP South Africa, Unilever and KFC.Black River FC is a small agency with a big heart and a confusing name. Although it’s not a football club, it is a group of team players with a healthy respect for its clients, their needs and each other. The ability to pull together is what sets them apart.
