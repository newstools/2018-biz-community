Ogilvy SA CCO Pete Case highlighted the achievement of winning three of the four golds awarded in the Experiential Media category; “This is the kind of innovative work that we’re proud to have created. Work that cuts through for brands such as Carling Black Label’s Soccer Song of Change, the OMO Dirt Book and Volkswagen’s Marco Polo Game. They’re all good examples of breaking the mould and finding different routes to today’s audiences.” Ogilvy’s strength in online campaigns was acknowledged with ten golds in the category, including one for the massively popular KFC ‘Keep Rolling’ video and three for DSTV. The work for KFC gathered over 3.9 billion impressions and over 51 million views in the first two weeks of being seeded online.
