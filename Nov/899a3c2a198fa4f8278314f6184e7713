<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/471005-625x407.jpg" alt="GroupM moved house this month" width="625" height="407">The move brings together all Cape Town-based GroupM teams into one location, giving clients easier access to the best talent, capability and integrated solutions. Mindshare and Wavemaker moved to the new premises this month, while MediaCom and Yonder will move shortly after these companies have settled in. According to Federico de Nardis, CEO of GroupM Sub-Saharan Africa, the company has come a long way since the days where all its agency networks were competing in the market separately. “By working under the same roof, we can more easily share all the technological investments that our group has done in recent years, as well as make use of the aforementioned platforms while delivering constant training to our teams,” says De Nardis. GroupM has completely reshaped its group structure in order to support its agency brands better. The structure is now organised around central platforms such as Audience Intelligence, Media Intelligence, and Digital Services. These platforms work together, delivering a higher standard more efficiently to clients. A new headspace The new office is located in Black River Park, 2 Fir Street, Observatory, Cape Town, in a very conveniently located business park. According to Property24, the Observatory area, also known as "Obs", is “a thriving business community thanks to its central location and public transport options.” For young professionals, this bohemian, artistic yet thriving area is a very convenient residential area due to its proximity to the N2 highway and Cape Town’s CBD, making it a perfect location for all three of the company’s staff. “We have a young and hungry team in Cape Town who wants to grow the business and demonstrate that we can do some groundbreaking work merging creativity and technology,” says De Nardis. “But more importantly, this space will be a place where the GroupM agencies can work and collaborate together. Ultimately, this move is another step towards our vision to grow our presence, our business and our impact in Cape Town.” For more information, please contact: Federico de Nardis, Groupm SSA CEOEmail: Federico.denardis@groupm.combRev('brev-f71be40a-68d6-4c5b-a0c0-00b9e2200537', '>a/\<moc.mpuorg@sidraned.ociredeF>"moc.mpuorg;46#&sidraned.ociredeF:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')Office: +27 11 582 6010
