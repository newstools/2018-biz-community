<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470749-625x87.jpg" alt="Chairman's Conversation with Johann Rupert" width="625" height="87">In South Africa Rupert is Chairman of Remgro, an investment holding company with over 30 investee companies in private healthcare, banking, insurance, consumer products, petroleum products, media, sports, and infrastructure, both in the listed and unlisted spaces. Remgro owns significant stakes in Mediclinic, First Rand, Outsurance, Discovery, Distell, RCL Foods, Total and e.tv to mention a few. Some of the well-known consumer-facing brands in Remgro-owned companies include Rainbow Chicken, Selati Sugar, Mageu, Sunbake, Nola Mayonnaise, Rama, Stork, Flora and various alcohol brands. Mkhari explains why Rupert was a natural choice for this year’s Chairman’s Conversation: “While Rupert is a well-established businessman, he remains an enigma to many South Africans. We know of some of his companies and products, but what do we really know about this man? Johann Rupert is in every aspect of SA life. We interface with his products and services on a daily basis, whether you are young or old, rich or poor.” Mkhari added, “Our economy is as challenged as it is equally contested, we can all benefit from engaging a global business figure like Rupert, who continues to be a very influential player in our economy. His input on the question of economic transformation and growth is of critical importance.” Should you like to send questions for the Chairman’s Conversation, please email RupertOnPOWER@power987.co.zabRev('brev-7b8d9167-0c0d-4a74-abb7-c5bcc0947bc7', '>a/\<az.oc.789rewop@REWOPnOtrepuR>"az.oc.789rewop;46#&REWOPnOtrepuR:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<'). #RupertOnPOWER | @powerfm987 | www.power987.co.zaFor more information, please contact slungilem@msgsales.co.zabRev('brev-04a24468-0b0f-4916-b04d-68a14b140a40', '>a/\<az.oc.selasgsm@melignuls>"az.oc.selasgsm;46#&melignuls:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or masego@power987.co.zabRev('brev-27df4dec-d4d3-4283-8c20-c6cfe2478061', '>a/\<az.oc.789rewop@ogesam>"az.oc.789rewop;46#&ogesam:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<'). <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470750-625x451.jpg" alt="Chairman's Conversation with Johann Rupert" width="625" height="451">
