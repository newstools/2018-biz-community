Mpho and Parmeshan join current directors Wayne Bischoff, Wayne Bishop, Karen Bailey, Lyn Jones and Rob Smuts. Wayne Bischoff says: “Both Mpho and Parmeshan are old hands at Amasa so to speak, having spent the past five and three years on the committee respectively. They have already added enormous value to the committee and we have no doubt that they will continue to do so as directors of Amasa.” <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469805.jpg" alt="Mpho Maseko" width="180" height="180">Mpho Maseko<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469806.jpg" alt="Parmeshan Moodliar" width="180" height="180">Parmeshan MoodliarAfter working on the Monthly Forums portfolio for a few years, Mpho moved over to the Gordon Patterson Amasa Learnership Programme (GP-ALP) portfolio, an entry point into the media and advertising industries that provides young individuals with fully funded bursaries for the Amasa Media Management Course.  “This opportunity then created an easy transition for me to lead the Amasa Education portfolio from 2017/18,” she says. “I believe the work that we do on the committee is crucial for the industry, serving the entire integrated marketing and communications industry and will always be of value to marketing and media professionals in South Africa.  Being involved in Amasa, now as a director, gives me the opportunity to give back to the industry that has developed me as professional and  exposed me to a wide spectrum of media and advertising professionals who continue to help build my skills and expertise.” Parmeshan has spent the past few years on various profiles including the Workshop, Golf Day, Awards and Annual Party portfolios. He says: “Education remains the primary pillar of Amasa and this focus area, through the Media Management course and the Gordon Patterson Amasa Learnership Programme, facilitates new blood gaining access to and information about our industry as a whole. "I am extremely proud to be part of an organisation like Amasa that has stepped up and stepped in to drive debate and change around the current state of the media industry and in many cases, how these issues impact the future. While Amasa has always been synonymous with education and networking opportunities, we have also grown into a professional organisation despite the challenge of being run by volunteers,” he says. “I have the primary focus of identifying and solidifying our relationships with our primary suppliers, sponsors and members who give of their time, resources and finances to assist us with what we do.” Parmeshan will oversee the body’s commercial relationship with stakeholders in order to safeguard the financial well-being of the organisation. Being extremely passionate about transformation in the industry adds additional impetus to his role. “Transformation must remain front and centre within the media and advertising sector. For me, any significant change starts with individuals who are willing to drive change from within themselves and their organisations. It is my hope and genuine belief that this personal change among many individuals will then affect change to the greater whole. "We need to take responsibility for our own industry and the time of criticism from the side lines without putting skin in the game yourself has ended. I would encourage all media professionals to get involved in our industry, even if it’s in a small way. You be will humbled by the difference you can make.” For more information on Amasa visit www.amasa.org.za or find us on Facebook or Twitter.
