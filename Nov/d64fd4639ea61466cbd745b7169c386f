Where do you live, work and play?I live in Padfield Park. It is somewhat in the countryside of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), between Kloof and Pinetown.I work for Kagiso Media. As general manager for East Coast Radio, I’m responsible for managing the regional commercial radio station in KZN.KZN is my home and my playground.2. What’s your claim to fame?

Describe your career so far. My career has been very diverse, interesting and not centred around one industry. Along this path called a career, I have learned that business is business, regardless of industry. It about the 7Ps marketing model, but most importantly, it’s about top and bottom line.    View this post on InstagramWhat a privilege to work with such dedicated and hard working team, together we are taking ECR from good to GREAT. Individually these ladies have been with ECR for more than 20 years and Boni...3 years and together we are loving the good to GREAT journey ����#TheAteam #Happy22ndBirthdayECR #WeAreHereToLead #SuccessIsKnowingWhereUComeFrom #KnowingWhereYouAre #AndKnowingWhereUAreGoing #LetsGo����A post shared by  Boni Mchunu (@bonimchunu) on Oct 9, 2018 at 10:27am PDTFor the longest of time, my career was centred around marketing, however, with my current experience as the station general manager of ECR, my experience has grown to include a broader corporate/business understanding. At ECR, I’m responsible for ensuring that the business is efficient and fully operational. Secondly, my responsibility is to ensure that the business has the required resources to function optimally and deliver profitable revenue for the shareholder. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. I love life and this for me means going to places with my husband and friends, taking holidays with my kids, and dining out. It also means exploring new things – I learnt how to ride a bike when my first son was born. I love running and cycling.5. What do you love about your industry? I love media because it’s not static; it’s exciting and fast-paced. Being in the media, and particularly radio means we can influence the lives of the people we serve, so I consider this opportunity as a privilege that I will cherish for as long as I live. We connect millions of South Africans with the world and we bring the world to South Africa, particularly to KZN.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/429037.jpg" alt="KZN Business Conversations reveal the province undersells itself" width="120" height="120">KZN Business Conversations reveal the province undersells itselfKwaZulu-Natal needs to be confident about its business offerings, rather than undersell itself as a business destination, it emerged at the first installment of KZN Business Conversations...Issued by East Coast Radio 13 Feb 20186. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Every day I wake up with an attitude that says, “I’m blessed to see another day to serve my family, all ECR employees, KZN and all stakeholders.” Upon waking up, I tune into ECR on 94.95FM to listen to my breakfast team. Every day without fail, I drive to work listening to ECR and our breakfast show helps me to start the day on a high.   View this post on InstagramI admire this guy...I get inspired by his leadership style and Im learning so much from him... #leadership #inspirationalleadership #RichardBransonA post shared by  Boni Mchunu (@bonimchunu) on Oct 22, 2018 at 8:13am PDTMy day-to-day job is mainly about meeting my team of internal stakeholders and making decisions that can make or disrupt the rhythm of the business. I work closely with the senior management team on various operational matters at ECR. Together, we are responsible for making sure that we deliver on company strategy. We have a strategic operational plan, which serves as a guiding document to help us align our actions with strategy.I’m an open book, what you see is what you get and I believe very much in an open-door policy, so I make it a point that I see the entire team at ECR both structurally and un-structurally. I like to have conversations with people regarding business ideas and innovation.Over- and above-structured departmental meetings, I do my ‘floor walks’ every Friday and I try to see as many of my team members as I possibly can. 7. What are the tools of your trade? Listen more and talk less, especially with staffStakeholder engagement, with both listeners and advertisersResearch before making any changesBrand marketing, especially to reach out to the millennials and the hybrid consumersRelevance – being in the know. Content is king in this industry, but it has to be delivered creatively and authenticallyThe importance of a multimedia offering – digital integration to radio is fundamental8. Who is getting it right in your industry?Kagiso Media, especially the ECR brand within the group. We are the most proudly diverse radio station in KZN, we are market leaders in the digital space, and we are at the forefront of exploring the digital landscape. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/437253.jpg" alt="East Coast Radio scoops four prestigious industry awards" width="120" height="120">East Coast Radio scoops four prestigious industry awardsEast Coast Radio walked away with four awards at the prestigious Liberty Radio Awards ceremony in Sandton...Issued by East Coast Radio 17 Apr 2018ECR also has the biggest website in terms of UBs in South Africa.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. I personally think radio is undervalued in South Africa, and I think it is a very powerful medium. The industry has not worked together to validate the importance of radio, which is why the new media is sometimes perceived to be better than traditional media, like ours.Secondly, media – not just radio, but overall – in South Africa is lagging in terms of transformation for both race and gender, equally. I don’t think there is enough supporting structure to enable transformation to prosper, and therefore people, especially women and people of colour, don’t stay long in this industry. 10. What are you working on right now? There is a lot! We are working on market study research, which I’m very excited about because it will inform our future strategic intentions. We are also working on a brand campaign that will take ECR from good to a great brand, in both KZN and South Africa.11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. ‘Podcasting’ and ‘digital’ are the buzzwords currently. Simply put, podcasting is on-demand audio content, replayed online.My favourite catchphrases are ‘greatness’ and ‘leadership’. I love both these. I utter them a lot and this is what they mean for me:Greatness is not an event, it is about showing up and showing up entirely every day. Leadership is not about the title, it is about leading yourself within the space that you occupy.   View this post on Instagram�� �� The journey continues #Leadership #Serve #greatnessA post shared by  Boni Mchunu (@bonimchunu) on Nov 12, 2018 at 12:16pm PST12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Mainly when I’m running, or when I’m reading something that triggers an idea.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I love cooking for my family; my husband adores everything that I cook for him. I love beautiful spaces and I think I have an eye for beautiful home pieces… when I’m big one day I would like to venture and explore interior decoration. 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? I’m not a technophobe at all. I love technology and I think it is the new global buzzword. It is fascinating to see what technology can do today, like with #FeesMustFall and #MeToo. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449798.jpg" alt="#UnStoppable women to share their secrets at this year's FNB Business Women's Breakfast" width="120" height="120">#UnStoppable women to share their secrets at this year's FNB Business Women's BreakfastWhat do a television presenter who is also a businesswoman, an entrepreneur, a social media lawyer and a doctor turned self-made businesswoman have in common?..Issued by East Coast Radio 20 Jul 2018These campaigns were brought to life through technology, which for me re-emphasises the importance of this powerful and well-adopted innovation by all global citizens.
