Leaving many clients unhappy and vulnerable to fraud. South African multinationals doing business in both the European Union (EU) and South Africa, as a result, have to start complying and prioritising the compliance of both GDPR and the Protection of Personal Information (PoPI) Act.Privacy and ethics a major trend for 2019Many organisations in South Africa have posed the question: Why should we be GDPR compliant if we are located in South Africa and not the EU? Well, GDPR applies to any organisation holding the data of European citizens and has a worldwide applicability. This is why Gartner has identified data privacy and ethics as one of the top technology trends for 2019.In addition to GDPR, South African firms must also comply with PoPI Act - which shares many characteristics with GDPR but extends to protect the personal data of any South African legal entity. However, those organisations that do business elsewhere in Africa are finding that many of its fellow African countries have their own variations of data protection regulations that must be supported as well.If you are non-compliant – consumers will vote with their feetPrivacy is not simply a compliance or legal problem.

Companies therefore need to define their ethical position with respect to the use of data and ensure that this position is reflected in their policies.Who is responsible?The complexity of data management in modern businesses is tremendous. It is tempting to assume that data privacy and protection is a legal problem - assigning it to the Compliance team, or to appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and make data privacy his or her problem. Yet, the reality is that data privacy is an all-encompassing challenge that goes well beyond the legal and security implications.Organisations should realise that everybody that works with data is responsible for data privacy - with ultimate accountability lying with the board.As a result, companies need to have clearly defined data policies, assign clear accountability (ownership) and ensure that they understand where personal data is stored, what it is being used for, and whether this is in line with the acceptable use policy.Data governance is keyData governance brings order to the complexity of modern business. Data governance is not about managing data – it is about governing behaviour.
