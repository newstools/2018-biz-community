Research must be conducted so that you can create content with the tone and style that will resonate most with your audience. The way you write for teenagers will be different from the way you write for senior citizens.Once you have decided who your target audience is, you must identify the problem that your service or product will help resolve. This way you can highlight the benefits of your product or service. Remember that you are writing copy for a website. Always keep in mind that website visitors do not read website content in the same way they read printed text. This is because website copy is not read – it is scanned. Website visitors scan a page looking for words they want or need. If those words are not present on the page they will move on to the next webpage.1. Start with the most important information firstMake sure your audience knows exactly what your product or service is about as soon as possible. Create content that is engaging, interesting and persuasive at the same time. 2. Use language that resonates with your audience and product or serviceUse effective web copy that resonates with your audience and relates to your product or service. It’s great to use creativity in your writing but if your audience is just scanning your text you want to make sure that you get your point across as soon as possible. Using effective, clear, concise and simple language will do this faster. Therefore, the text on your page should be as clear and obvious so that your audience knows exactly what it is about with they visit your website.3. Use headlinesHeadlines grab your audience’s attention, directing them to certain sections and allowing them to see if you have what they are looking for on your website. Make sure your headlines are clear and to the point, communicating what your product or service entails.4. Use captions, quotes and imagesThe use of captions, quotes and images can be an effective way to grab your audience attention. 5. Use familiar wordsEnsure that your text consists of familiar words that will resonate with your audience. These familiar words, also known as “care words”, will help turn a lead into a customer. This is because these words help sell your product or service. If you are selling jeans, for example, your audience may want to see the words ‘stylish’ or ‘slim fit’. If you own a travel agency your audience may want to see the words “cheap flight”. These care words will help ensure your text is effective and compelling for your audience. 6. Use short paragraphsUsing short paragraphs and sentences will help make sure that your audience does not have to spend too much time looking for what they are trying to find. The use of bullet points is also very effective. 7. Make your website easy to followOptimise your entire website for easy reading and navigation, not just your home page. You don’t know what page your audience will start on or what link they will click to access your website. Creating an effective, compelling and persuasive website copy is imperative. Not only does it help to create a professional image of your brand online, but it also attracts readers to your site and keeps them engaged persuading them to act and use your product or service.
