The fifth annual quiz saw 21 teams comprised of six members, compete to be crowned 2018 champion. And to add to the mix, media agencies battled it out against media owners. After an evening of fierce competition and four rounds of questions ranging from general knowledge to sport, the winner emerged from Wavelength and Ultimate media, a hybrid of a media agency and media owner, and therefore bragging rights are split between agency and owners. Second place was awarded to Heart Radio and third to Vizeum. Over R36,000 was raised on the night, thanks to generous team and sponsor donations which helped us beat our previous raised amount of R25,000. The teams who entered this year were Tiso Black Star, Heart FM, Primedia Broadcasting, Tractor Outdoor, PHD, Vizeum, Ads 24, TC Wavelength, Spark Media, DStv, Carat, OMD, Initiative Media, NMPI Digital, Mediashop, Exponential Media, Hitch Digital, Amplify and Relativ Media. Sponsors who donated prizes included Bvlgari, Santam, Issey Miyake, Tractor Outdoor, Primedia Broadcasting, DStv, Elle Saab, Narciso Rodriguez, Heart Radio, e.tv, The Entertainer, Media 24 and a few more. Amasa would like to thank everyone who helped raise an outstanding amount and is looking forward to next yearâ€™s event.
