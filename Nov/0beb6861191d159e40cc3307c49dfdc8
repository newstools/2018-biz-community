Taxi branding is one of the most viewed channels for OOH advertising, with 73% of the South African population recall seeing taxi advertising in the past four weeks (AMPS 2015, re-weighted). “The mobility of taxi branding allows advertisers to enjoy the dual benefit of exposure at large convergence areas and, substantial audience viewing whilst en route,” says Lance Coertzen, Twizza’s Representative. “Ideally, this campaign will serve as responsive mobile billboards which promise to catch the eyes of many commuters and pedestrians on the move," he added.The campaign is built on calling out consumers to stand a chance of winning their share of R1m when buying any Twizza carbonated soft drink. In essence, the campaign is set to deliver a more personalised experience and allows consumers the opportunity to connect and engage with the brand more effectively.
