We need journalists to separate fact from fiction - a strong press leads to a strong democracy, where the values of truth and accountability persist," says Nationalist MEP Roberta Metsola, who is a member of the committee."Funding is particularly important for smaller media houses who are often faced with SLAPP lawsuits and vexatious claims designed to shut them down” observed Metsola.  Pilot projectThe funds will implement a pilot project across the EU with two main objectives: financially supporting investigative journalism and the direct support and protection of exposed journalists.A permanent fund will be created to support independent investigative journalists, with the aim of helping the journalists face potential legal proceedings, move between borders and maintain financial independence. Additionally, the support and protection of investigative journalists will be addressed by the creation of a pan-European rapid response mechanism. Through direct collaboration with European, regional and local stakeholders, this mechanism will provide direct support such as advice, legal aid and shelter to journalists under threat.                                                                                                                                                                         The funds will now have to be confirmed by a vote from all MEPs in the coming weeks.
