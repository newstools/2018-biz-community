It is a real honour to be a part of a brand that actually has something of value to offer to the consumer.”Director Tebogo Malope drew inspiration from the collaboration with Sugar Ray Leonard and eMedia, “The team at eMedia are creative, and they are also plugged into the streets. They are about the people, and they are about creative work like this. I realised I am in a space with kindred spirits who understand how to make work that resonates with our people.”No monthly feesCurrently installed in over 1.4 million households, Openview is South Africa’s first subscription-free direct-to-home satellite TV offering.
