As SLJI, we identify local, national and international exhibitions where our SMMEs can participate, exposing their products to a wide range of markets. Recently, we participated at this yearâ€™s Jewellex Africa exhibition at the Sandton Convention Centre and also at the China International SME Fair to be able to access the international market and form relationships.Access to metalsIt is not easy for SMMEs to access metals to help with the production of jewellery due to license requirements. Therefore, SLJI bridges the gap by bringing the metals to SMMEs for easy access.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470189.jpg" alt="#EntrepreneurMonth: Jewellery SMME incubator looks to develop, support local startups" width="625" height="470">Access to state of the art technologyAs a lot of our SMMEs are based in the rural/sub-rural areas, access to advanced technology for mass production or for high quality products is a challenge for them.
