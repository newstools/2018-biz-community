<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/467091.jpg" alt="Simply Wonder-ful" width="500" height="355">Wonder is a brand of plant fertiliser that, we suspect, many of us have bought and used, but were never even aware of the brand name. Like many brands, Wonder became more about the technical jargon and scientific formulation of their products, less about their consumers. Add to that the ever-growing category of products catering to the avid gardener/foodscaper, and one is left with a heritage brand that simply blends into the on-shelf clutter.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/467092.jpg" alt="Simply Wonder-ful" width="500" height="355">The Just Design Jhb team set out to re-evaluate Wonder and its products – starting at the brand’s roots. Wonder needed to regain its purpose in peoples’ lives and reflect the fact that it offers a long term, purposeful solution to everyday gardening problems. It’s less about the how, and more about the result!  The eventuate brand and packaging upgrade offers consumers an approachable brand, with products that talk to results over formulation; with rounded type and beautiful visuals to demonstrate the solutions. Navigation through the range has been made super easy – ditching jargon for consumer speak and using colour to differentiate between the segments. But above all, Wonder has become that trusted gardening companion again – offering gardeners the tools to be creative – using the soil as their canvas and the plants as their paints.Want to read about insights, trends and other cool stuff?
