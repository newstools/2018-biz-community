The Young Journalist Award is focused on furthering the career of a dynamic young South African journalist.  Olebogeng will now go on to a further round, competing against the Young Journalist award recipients in other regions for the national award.  At stake is the chance of a lifetime for the national winner to accelerate his or her professional and personal development through an all-expenses-paid trip to follow cutting-edge training overseas at the renowned Thomson Foundation and in a newsroom context. The Breaking News/Live Reporting category awards journalists who can think on their feet, often reporting in danger or at disaster scenes, without technical support or a carefully crafted script. Josca co-won this category for her coverage of the derailment of the Shosholoza Meyl, almost arriving simultaneously with the emergency services and the authorities. Says Nick Efstathiou, OFM General Manager: “Congratulations to these two young stalwarts of the OFM newsroom!  Their dedication and commitment to ‘get the story’ is evident the quality of their work.  It seems the future of news is in good hands.  I hope they go on to win big at the national awards as they are both so deserving.” This event chose the best of the best in the Free State, Northern Cape, North West and Limpopo.
