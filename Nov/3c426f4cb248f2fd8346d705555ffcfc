The design features give Nando’s real-time information about customer journeys through their Casas and enables them to respond quickly to a range of key product or service imperatives such as service issues, product improvement, food quality, overall experience etc.The programme uses a multimedia approach including SMS, Web, in-store elements, contact centre and critically the till-slip, which is fast becoming a key interaction medium with customers.  The “Talk to Nando’s” programme has successfully been rolled-out to 280 Casas and in a short space of time the programme has developed into a key insights’ platform for Nando’s and has been instrumental in multiple key business decisions.Jake Orpen, Managing Director of nudge, congratulated Nando’s adding “It has been remarkable what Nando’s has been able to achieve with “Talk to Nando’s” in a short period of time. Nando’s continues to challenge us daily with their ideas and enthusiasm.
