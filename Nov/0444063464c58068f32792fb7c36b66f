On the pledge, Celia Collins, Managing Director of Carat Johannesburg, stated: “Hot 91.9 is a community radio station that generally does a lot for the previously disadvantaged people within South Africa. Last year Hot FM started an annual Teddy-thon to raise money for this initiative; it now being its second year, the target had increased from R1 million to R1.5 million. Having over the past 12 months seen how much they have given back to the community and how passionate they are to upliftment, DAN decided to join in on this. Being able to touch numerous lives, through education and health care, is truly inspirational. It is a fantastic opportunity and heart-warming to see communities get together to help others so close to Christmas.”
