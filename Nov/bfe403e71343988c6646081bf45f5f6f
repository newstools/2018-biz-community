So, while we are delighted, and tonight we will celebrate, tomorrow we will wake up and we will work harder to achieve more.” It’s about never giving upFor Joe Public Connect the awards are a realisation of months of hard work. “Overnight success takes hours, days and months and requires hard work, grit, determination, guts people with an attitude to growth, and brave clients who trust you,” says Dani Morley, managing partner of Joe Public Connect.  She adds that the agency is really committed to the growth of their people and clients. “Our culture speaks volumes about what we saw happen tonight. It is about never giving up and coming to work and loving what you do.
