Musically, performances were in abundance and the public were treated to live sets by  Connell Cruise, Beverly Jayne, The Cappuccinos, The Cover Ups, The Entourage, Thee Jam and former Westlife star Brian McFadden who all set the stage on fire and catapulted Sandton City into one old-skool party.A clearly delighted Hot 91.9FM managing director, Lloyd Madurai, said, "The vision of Hot 91.9FM has always been to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those around us through sustainable projects within our community. The DNA of the station is about fun and playing Joburg’s best Old Skool and R&B. Over the past four years Hot 91.9FM has become the number one in the hearts of our listeners and has changed the landscape of radio with a purpose and cause  in Joburg. We are simply a conduit for the generosity of our audience.  To all our sponsors, partners and friends that pledged to change lives, we would like to say a heartfelt, sincere and resounding ‘thank you!’ You have made the Hot 91.9FM Birthday wish come true!"
