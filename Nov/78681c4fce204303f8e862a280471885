Users will be able to listen to OFM on Deezer through all devices, with or without Wi-Fi or 4G. The app offers a number of options, including free listening, a premium plan, family package or student package, among others. Says Nick Efstathiou, OFM General Manager: “It’s a fact that OFM is listened to far beyond our FM footprint. Thanks to live streaming our audience is literally global. By joining Deezer, even more people will be introduced to OFM and I’m confident that they too will become loyal listeners of the radio station!”
