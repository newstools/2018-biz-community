The communication skills you’ll develop while learning to manipulate language and express yourself even more concisely are transferrable to any job. In addition, your non-verbal communication skills will improve and you’ll be able to ‘read’ people more effectively. All of this is over and above the ‘how to’ that will be addressed in learning to teach language in a communicative and student-centred manner. By the end of the course, you’ll notice a tangible difference and awareness of your own language as well as that of other people, making you more competitive in the marketplace even if you choose not to teach EFL. Why do TESOL at Wits Language SchoolWith most employers looking for a minimum of a 120-hour TESOL course with teaching practice, Wits Language School provides exactly this with options to suit all schedules. 1.	Authentic teaching practiceWe provide Full-time (4 weeks, Monday – Friday), Part-time (12 weeks, 2 evenings per week plus Saturday mornings) and Blended Learning (12 weeks online, 1 week on-site) options for our 120-hour TESOL course. All of these options include guided teaching practice with genuine EFL adult students. This ensures that you have some exposure to typical classroom situations before you start working as an EFL teacher. Each lesson you teach is immersive and observed with detailed and personalised feedback provided our trainers to help you improve in future lessons. 2.	Comprehensive course materialAt the start of the course, you will receive a detailed manual with study notes to guide you through the theoretical component. You will be provided with examples of lesson plans, course material to use in your teaching practice and more. Written assignments are tailored to address common issues in teaching as well as the students you teach during the course. Together with the teaching practice, you are provided numerous opportunities to develop your language awareness and practical skills, making you more competitive in the marketplace. 3.	Experienced and highly qualified trainersAll of our trainers have local and international teaching experience in addition to very specialised postgraduate qualifications. As a result, trainees are exposed to a diverse range of advice and teaching knowledge as well as practical advice related to working as an EFL teacher abroad. We’re happy to assist with those difficult, country-specific questions that many recruiters don’t talk about. We’ve also carefully vetted each of the recruitment companies we work with to ensure that you’re supported and appropriately guided in your job search after completing your TESOL. Even once you’ve completed the base TESOL course (or a similar teaching course), there are still many opportunities to enhance your knowledge in language teaching. Add to your qualification with one of our specialisation courses, like Teaching Business English or Young Learners, and find your niche in education. You can even take a Grammar for English Teachers course if you’re looking to improve your own language knowledge prior to doing the TESOL or just to refresh your knowledge. Whatever course you choose, we guarantee it will be an exciting and rewarding experience that will leave you wanting more.
