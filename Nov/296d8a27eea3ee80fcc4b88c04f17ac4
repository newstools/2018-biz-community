Strategy is keyThe first step in any marketing campaign is creating a solid strategy that will form the core of all your communication and visuals. The strategy will guide you and your team along the campaign process to ensure that your messaging hits the mark and projects the right kind of brand presence into a digital space, without disrupting vital aspects of the brand’s persona. The strategy will outline your campaign objectives, define the insight and key focus points to ensure that everything produced and published online builds on a united archetype.2. Know your brandWhat do you offer people and how will this impact the market? Knowing your product, what story you’re telling and how you can distinguish yourself from the millions of other brands online, will be one of the biggest factors within your campaign. It’s up to brands to not only clearly portray what they’re about but also to engage and grow their target market in new and innovative ways.3. Find your gapSocial media is a fast-paced environment with new content going live every few seconds, making it almost impossible to gain traction when your campaign needs it most. This is why trend-watching and strategic brand alignment often leads to success and a wider projected campaign reach. Understanding how the people within your market think, act and react, and then engaging with them on their own platforms, is key to trend alignment and brand association, which prompts user-generated content, allowing your social campaign to flourish even with limited financial backing.4. Creativity will drive your campaignEvery campaign is different in their objective and the desired outcome, however, one singular commonality remains; to create an experience that allows people to fluidly immerse themselves into your brand. Creating unique experiences for people will allow them to gain a better understanding of your brand and why they would want you to fulfil their needs.5. Inspire - A lasting impressionThe success of a social campaign also depends on what you’re trying to achieve. Each campaign is as unique as the brand it is tied to, therefore measuring “success” within a basic margin of results does not give enough credibility to the campaign and the effect it had on the user. One of the underlying aspects of a successful campaign lies in the emotion and reaction it was able to evoke. Take into consideration that your consumer is human, a person. They don’t want to be fed autonomous information but treated as an individual who can indulge in the moment, thrive in what you have to offer and feed off of the inspiration that your message brings to life. Allow a person to feel and you will have created a lasting impression, which, inevitably leads to brand loyalty and the success of your social campaign.
