The competition is open to individuals as well as schools, organisations, teams and families. Entrants will upload their videos, sharing them across social media with the hashtag #AnthemProject, encouraging their communities to vote for their entry. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469845.jpg" alt="News24 launches the Anthem Project with OUTsurance" width="300" height="435">Says Adriaan Basson, editor in chief News24, “At a time when South Africans are yearning for hope, this is the perfect tonic to lift our collective spirit. Press the red button and sing your lungs out!” Peter Cronje, OUTsurance chief marketing officer, says, “We’re very excited to help make the Anthem Project possible. Just like our clients, we’re proudly South African and we’re constantly looking at how we can help our communities, driven by our brand promise that absolutely everyone gets something out.”Adds Myles Brown, head of BrandStudio.24: “We are extremely excited about this campaign. As South Africa’s leading digital news brand, we have a responsibility and opportunity to embrace and promote goodwill in our country, and what better way to do this than through our beautiful anthem.”  At the end of the project, three winners will each win a share of R1m in prizes for the charity of their choice. The prizes are a combination of cash, as well as media exposure on the 24.com network for the charities. Entries close on 19 April 2019 and the winners will be announced on 17 May 2019. The videos will be judged on how they show national pride; whether they display a sense of the Ubuntu Spirit and caring for fellow South Africans; show creativity and enthusiasm; inspire the nation and if they enjoy public support. For more information go to: https://anthemproject.news24.com/Videos/how-to-upload-your-own-anthem-20180928.
