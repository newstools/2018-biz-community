The agency’s MD, Brenda Khumalo, says the awards are a culmination of a 24- month journey. “I am beyond words because it has been such a journey. It has been a journey because of the amount of work we have put in over the past two years and where we have come from as a company.” She adds that it goes to show that with true dedication, commitment, hard work and team spirit you can do and achieve anything. “I really am feeling emotional with this achievement knowing where we have come from and how hard we have worked to get to this point. I really am beyond words.” Enduring partnershipsThe Partnership Award went to FCB Joburg/Toyota. Brett Morris, FCB Africa’s group chief executive officer says it is great to have an award that honours partnerships with clients as this is something we do not do enough. “Agency client partnerships go through difficult and good times. The ones that endure are the ones that really help build brands over time and that is what we are proud of. The most important thing is that we do a great job for Toyota’s business over time.” He adds that Toyota is a client who believes in enduring partnerships and they have a long-term view. “It is amazing to be part of that.” <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1712/423074-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Brett Morris, FCB Africa Group CEO and group CCO." width="120" height="120">Toyota loves FCB Africa: The 57 year-strong brand relationshipToyota formally announced earlier today that it is continuing its "exceptionally good, regularly measured" relationship with "the best of the best", FCB Africa.
