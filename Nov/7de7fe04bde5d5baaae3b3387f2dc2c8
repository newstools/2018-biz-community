Currently, there is a lot of support at the super early stage and so most small companies struggle to scale when they leave the incubator stage. Incubators should measure their success based on the ability of their startups to graduate successfully and/or to raise funding, not just counting the numbers in their intake. Demo days and pitching competitions should give real value to entrepreneurs as opposed to just being a show..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the importance of entrepreneurship, especially in a country such as this?In a country with high unemployment rates like South Africa, entrepreneurship is very important to create income and jobs for people who cannot get jobs.
