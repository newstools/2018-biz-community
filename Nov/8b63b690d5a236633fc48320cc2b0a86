ADSG will work out of Upper Pepper, Egg's new offices in the Bo-Kaap. Adrian made his name at Velocity, where his work featured repeatedly on sites like Shots; won everywhere from the Clios to Dubai Lynx to The Loeries; and was named Millward-Brown's Best Liked Ad of the Year, among other accolades. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470271.jpg" alt="Adrian de sa Garces launches ADSG, repped by Egg in SA" width="615" height="260">In addition to his advertising work, Adrian exhibits his black-and-white landscape and abstract photography as Republic of Nowhere. His strong photographic eye is evident in all his work but he's a true all-rounder, as comfortable working with complex VFX and animation as he is with performance and story. "I've always loved Adrian's work and admired his gift for craft-driven comedy," says Colin Howard, Egg Films' executive producer. "And Lisa's family - in multiple ways - so we're delighted to have them as part of our nest."
