In keeping with this, TBWA\ South Africa recently hosted its second annual digital week; DCDC, which celebrates the speed of culture through a three-day interactive festival, dedicated to the pillars of data, content, digital and culture.This exploration of unimagined opportunities where technology intersects culture attracts TBWA\ agencies who convene in Johannesburg, to collaborate with industry heavyweights which this year included Facebook and Google. Sean Donovan, group CEO of TBWA\ South Africa, says that by 2020 the change in business systems that we have been experiencing for the past few years will have reach a tipping point. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470563.jpg" alt="A workforce ready to disrupt in the Fourth Industrial Revolution" width="300" height="306">“We will need to consider how this impacts communication, personal privacy and the methods of personal interaction with the world around us. We also see that changes will not be incremental but rather broadly disruptive, with fluctuations to entire systems and across sectors.” He continues that, “DCDC is one of the ways which TBWA\ South Africa is gearing up to becoming the agency of the now. Through interactive learning opportunities, which will align associated skills with the needs for change, we are well poised to grow our business and the business of our clients.” According to a World Economic Forum report, over one-third of skills (35%) that are considered important in today’s workforce will be impacted by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. With creativity and coordinating with others (collaboration) becoming some of the top five skills workers will need in order to benefit from the avalanche of new products, new technologies and new ways of working. “TBWA\ South Africa is already living this paradigm and imparting knowledge and systems among our clients to up-skill, re-skill and build solid foundations,” concludes Donovan. DCDC 2018 ProgrammeThis year, the event programme included a ­­full day at Facebook Africa, led by the social media giant’s Head of Agencies in MENA, Ian Manning.
