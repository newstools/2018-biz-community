Top executives from 50 companies were in attendance including the team from Alliance Media Kenya.  "There has never been a more exciting time to identify and celebrate the region's top brands. As Superbrands continues to identify the cream of the crop, the brands highlighted continue to provide inspiration to those aspiring to create brands with a difference," said Jawad Jaffer, the Project Director of  Superbrands East Africa. Alliance Media sees the recognition received by Superbrands East Africa for the past seven years as a true accolade as it underpins the fact that Alliance Media fully understands the importance of creating a strong brand. Alliance Media's clients use outdoor and airport advertising to build their brands across the African continent and this Superbrands Award shows that Alliance Media is a partner who knows how to grow brands. Superbrands is the world's largest independent arbiter of branding. It identifies and pays tribute to exceptional brands by recognising, rewarding and reinforcing leading brands from all over the world. Superbrand status strengthens a brand's position, adds prestige and sets the brand apart from its competitors. Alliance Media is Africa's leader in OOH (out-of-home advertising).
