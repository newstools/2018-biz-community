The OOH market is extremely competitive, so as a growing player we are humbled to take on this responsibility. We can’t wait to bring value not only to our advertisers, but to that community too,” said Joyleen Mahanetsa, Managing Director at Outsmart.  This follows Outsmart's successful tender bid to the Newcastle Municipality to exclusively operate in that OOH market. Newcastle is the seat for KZN’s Amajuba District and is the province’s third-largest urban centre.  Outsmart has proven itself a leader in unconventional and innovative OOH media solutions that are targeted at the LSM 4 - 8 markets. Their work in the tax rank environment is particularly notable, executing pioneering campaigns for their clients, including McDonalds, MTN and African Bank.  “We love what we do, so it is incredibly gratifying to bring solutions to advertisers that help them connect with their customers in a meaningful way. The opportunity to play and create memorable touch points in the OOH space is what drives us. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468091.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468092.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="530" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468093.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468094.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="530" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468095.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468096.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="530" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468097.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468098.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="530" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468099.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468100.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="479" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468101.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468102.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="602" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468103.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468104.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="602" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/468105.jpg" alt="Outsmart continues to grow its OOH national footprint" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1811/468106.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="602" class="gflipper-image" align="center">“There are often challenges in this industry that you simply can’t plan for, but one of our biggest strengths is our ability to push through and deliver excellence no matter how tight the deadline is.
