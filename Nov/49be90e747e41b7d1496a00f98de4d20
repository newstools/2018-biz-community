The car will then drive in the direction of the most-tweeted province. Once the car arrives in the most-tweeted province, people will then have to tweet the name of their city next to #GO, e.g. #GOJozi. The car will then drive in the direction of the most-tweeted city. When the car arrives in the most-tweeted city, people will then have to tweet the name of their suburb next to #GO, e.g. #GORosebank. The car will then drive in the direction of the most-tweeted suburb. Then, once the car arrives in the most-tweeted suburb, people will have to tweet one of five predetermined street names next to #GO, e.g. #GOBathAve. The car will then proceed to the winning street to park in a safe and undisclosed location. The first entrant to reach the Datsun GO, and provide the Datsun Tug of War keyword to the Datsun representative, will win the Datsun GO.
