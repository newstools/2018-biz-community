And so, in response to the season where everyone is prepared to be ‘extra’, Debonairs Pizza and its agency FCB Joburg endeavoured to make a meal that did the same. Introducing Ke Dezemba Box – a large Triple-Decker®, an extra side of your choice and an extra 1.5-litre Coke – all because ‘tis the season to be extra. The advertising campaign for this perfect-for-sharing meal was put forward by FCB Joburg’s creative team of Creative Director and Copywriter Mbeu ‘Snooze’ Kambuwa, Art Director Luzuko Witbooi and Copywriter Sandile Hamilton. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469075.jpg" alt="Debonairs Pizza launches 'Dezemba' campaign" width="315" height="177"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469076.jpg" alt="Debonairs Pizza launches 'Dezemba' campaign" width="315" height="177"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469077.jpg" alt="Debonairs Pizza launches 'Dezemba' campaign" width="315" height="177">From the product name to the campaign execution, the idea was designed to celebrate the South African spirit of Ke Dezemba Boss, a time where people get together and get down. The team felt that Debonairs Pizza’s Ke Dezemba Box was the perfect meal to tell this story, as it boasts a range of extras and is perfectly portioned for sharing. The ad takes the viewer on a journey through Durban Beachfront all the way to a ‘vibey chillaz’ overlooking a Joburg skyline. Featuring numerous scenes of contrasting South Africans’ every day approach to their ‘go big’ approach during the festive season. For example, there’s a beautiful girl getting ready for a date. The voice-over announces ‘Dezemba!’ and the shot shows her dressed to the nines all sparkly and fine, ready for her Dezemba date. Bevan Cullinan and Ian Difford of Picture Tree and Hungry Films directed the ad respectively, and post-production was handled by Orchestra Blue.
