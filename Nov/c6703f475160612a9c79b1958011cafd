Where do you live, work and play?It’s difficult for me to differentiate between work, travel or play as they all come together. I live and work mostly in Warsaw, Poland, where our indaHash headquarters are, but at the moment I spend around 30% of my time in our different offices around the world.   2. What’s your claim to fame? I would love to have ‘great singer’ as my claim to fame, but even though I practice (almost every Friday), I need a lot more practice! So my claim to fame is that I have the privilege of working with incredible people, who have allowed us to build an amazing company.   3. Describe your career so far. My career has been about learning as much as possible, working hard and doing my best to work smart at the same time. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1702/377636-120x120.jpg?1" alt="MediaCom and indaHash introduce South Africa to a new influencer marketing approach" width="120" height="120">MediaCom and indaHash introduce South Africa to a new influencer marketing approachMediacom and indaHash have launched their first joint campaign in South Africa this month. The campaign, executed on behalf of Revlon, marks the beginning of an exclusive, strategic South African partnership between MediaCom's content division, MediaCom Beyond Advertising (MBA), and indaHash.Issued by MediaCom 13 Oct 2016I believe in partnering with remarkable people, allowing myself the space to make mistakes as I adapt and build for change, and adjusting my plans and goals with the guidance of mentors.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. A great book with a glass of wine in a new place. I also love exploring how ancient practices like yoga and qigong enhance wellbeing and sharpen mental ability.5. What do you love about your industry? I love how technology is energised by imagination. The crossover of creativity, business savvy and innovation.

Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. A day for me is a constant mix of connection, feedback and strategy. I tap into the heartbeat of our company differently each hour, from local hallway connects with my teams, to global meetings, to the new ventures we explore with existing and new clients, as well as the constant development of our platform and services. 7. What are the tools of your trade? My phone! Not only does it put my whole company in the palm of my hand, but it also keeps me connected to clients and people.I remember when I first started working and the only way you could answer company emails was by sitting in front of a computer in the office. Now you can do this wherever you want!Other tools that we use to stay connected as a global company include Asana, Workplace, Google Docs and Google Calendar.         View this post on Instagram           What is most important for me is working with people who I both truly like and enjoy spending time with! Yesterday we had an awesome party because we are awesome! #team #indahash #startuplife #party #fridayvibes #love A post shared by  Barbara Soltysinska (@basia_soltysinska) on Nov 17, 2018 at 12:49pm PST My teams are all over the world, from the UK to Poland to South Africa to the US, so technology is essential for us to stay in touch.8. Who is getting it right in your industry? I think that both Hypr and InfluencerDB are impressive companies worth watching. 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. There needs to be a more strategic approach to influencer collaboration and campaign management. Things need to move from just being campaign-based and more into strategic alliances. 10. What are you working on right now? We’ve just launched indaHash Deal, which is exciting as it gives e-commerce brands and entrepreneurs the opportunity to work with influencers in return for discounts or free products. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1710/414675-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Barbara Soltysinska, co-founder of indaHash.com." width="120" height="120">ICO to increase audience valueIndaHash.com is launching its own universal cryptocurrency payment structure specifically for influencers to help them develop loyal and engaging audiences...By Danette Breitenbach 16 Oct 2017It is fully self-service and an easy way for brands to work with influencers, whilst achieving awesome, authentic content that they can use in their campaigns across a variety of platforms. 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. Buzzwords would include micro vs. macro vs. celebrity influencers, engagement rate, Influencer-Generated Content (IGC), faux and fake influencers, the list goes on... Even though they are used quite often and can be perceived as buzzwords, they are very needed to define this industry. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465675-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Influence or fraud?" width="120" height="120">Influence or fraud?The influencer industry continues to come under scrutiny as frauds and fakes give everybody else a bad name...By Federico Dedeu 26 Oct 2018I’ve been fortunate in being asked to speak at a number of fantastic marketing and tech conferences, and find myself using buzzwords a lot in providing insight into influencer marketing, a tool that even now, many companies are still being introduced to. 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? I have too many ideas and not enough time for all of them! I usually get my best ideas when I am relaxing. 13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I can sing the loudest, with the worst voice.14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? Technophile! I believe that the power of agility involves not only embracing technology but also moving with it and helping to drive innovation in a healthy and effective way.

I love the time difference when I am staying in Asia! #indahash #startup #startuplife A post shared by  Barbara Soltysinska (@basia_soltysinska) on Jul 24, 2017 at 12:35am PDT Too often, technophobia harms successful companies, as fear limits them from including solutions that could’ve prevented them from losing relevance amidst their consumers. 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? I have hundreds of apps, there is an app for everything! Scrolling through my phone you’ll find apps that help to streamline processes, so that I can easily flow into new activities throughout my day, without having to spend time preparing. From effective task management, feedback and communication, to mindfulness and conscious breathing apps.         View this post on Instagram           �� Conscious breathing: clear the mind, relax, be well. I wanted to share my experience of conscious breathing. It’s been powerful for me and I hope it can be for you too! Learning about breathing started with yoga ��‍♀️ then the Wim Hof Method (the technique of the Dutch ‘Iceman’ who withstands extreme cold! Thanks to him I also take cold showers! ☃️�� ) You do a very deep breath in, followed by a shallow breath out (in a series which takes around 15-20 min). His app and YouTube videos are great! I then attended a qigong course and finally @20m2 recommended I go for a rebirthing-breathwork session. It was 3 hours of extreme focus where you take a very deep breath in, a shallow breath out, all the while focusing on the breath, rather than your thoughts.�� Your consciousness really shifts and you don’t realise how time passes by! The awesome thing about it is that I feel so well & full of energy and the results last (I can say for me, at least 5 days, as I did it on Tuesday). If you haven’t experienced conscious breathing, I highly recommend these techniques and hope they give you as much energy as they’ve given me ✨���� #meditation #mindfulmoment #deepbreath #meditationtools #clearthemind #higherawareness #consciousbreathing #purposedrivenlife #yoga #wimhofmethod #qigongpractice #entrepreneurlife #mindset A post shared by  Barbara Soltysinska (@basia_soltysinska) on Nov 2, 2018 at 9:42am PDT Oh, and photos of my pets!16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Be yourself. We are all so uniquely different that this is the only way to truly live. Also, read a lot of news and do lots of research into the industry. Simple as that.
