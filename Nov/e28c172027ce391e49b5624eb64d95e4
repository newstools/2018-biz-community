Starting with year-end events, there are numerous reasons as to why an event of this nature should take its rightful place on the working calendar of any company. It is the one annual occasion where you get to show your appreciation to both your staff and your valued clients and go all out to impress! You can never go wrong with elegant and suitable décor, delicious food and fun entertainment. There really are no rules as to the type of function you should plan. Whether a lavish ball in a magnificent setting, fine dining and dancing or a finger-snack cocktail party, your only real concern is to spend time with these valuable guests, all of whom contribute to the success of your business. Choosing a perfect venue can be quite tricky at times, and for some odd reason, event co-ordinators and marketing managers often overlook the potential of their own premises. Not only is it less expensive to go this route, as there will obviously also be no venue hire, but it is the perfect time and opportunity (especially for clients) to showcase your premises and products. Additional costs charged by outside venues which all add up, i.e. parking, special security, sign-ins, etc. can also be avoided in this way. Set up a fancy marquee with an interactive demo room or games area involving your brand. Arrange décor, entertainment, catering and drinks along a central theme to make your guests feel as if they have been transported to another country and be assured that they will be talking about your event, premises and brand for months to come. Although there are many, here are just two good reasons to host a year-end function: > Acknowledgement, rewards and recognition of top performers Use the opportunity to acknowledge and reward good performance and loyal customers. This not only enhances a sense of pride but also creates good inroads and encourages future productivity. > Personal interaction We are all about digital, but personal interaction remains key to the success of any business. Due to busy working schedules and business commitments, many senior executives are unable to enjoy daily interaction with their staff and key customers. This less formal and more relaxing environment also creates an easy feedback channel. Product launches Co-ordinating a successful product launch can be quite a stressful project. A good mix of expertise and services is required, over and above extreme attention to detail. The slightest oversight could be disastrous, and due consideration should be given to the hiring of a professional eventing partner. It is quite amazing how sometimes co-ordinators overlook their own premises and grounds. This is a perfect area to create a venue for guests by using marquees, and an opportunity to showcase your product. Perhaps consider the possibility of a guided factory tour or a 'walk-about' in the grounds, tying your event up with pitstops and product demos along the way. A lot of customers find comfort in knowing where a product comes from, launching a product on your premises not only shows how it is made but also by whom. By bringing the customer to your premises you open the opportunity for staff on all levels to interact and feel involved in this exciting new development.
