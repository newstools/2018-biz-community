In fact, globally, only non-tech brand listed in the top 10 is McDonald’s.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1706/395427.png" alt="Tech's ‘fearsome five' dominate the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands 2017" width="120" height="120">Tech's ‘fearsome five' dominate the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands 2017Technology giants Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook take the top five places in the 2017 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown...Issued by Kantar Millward Brown 6 Jun 2017Foster explained that when looking specifically at the SA study, we need to remember the focus is on brands which are bred here, which excludes the likes of KFC. The inclusion of financials means that large private companies aren’t included either, and as the focus is on specific brands, holding companies like Tiger Brands and Unilever are excluded. Interestingly, not a single tech brand appears on the inaugural South African list, but many of the brands do use technology to create value.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/466797-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Standardbank team announced as the country’s most valuable brand at the inaugural BrandZ Top 30 Most Valuable South African Brands." width="120" height="120">Local banks shine at inaugural BrandZ Top 30 AwardsStandard Bank was crowned the country's most valuable brand at the inaugural BrandZ Top 30 Most Valuable South African Brands when it launched at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning...By Danette Breitenbach 1 Nov 2018Two of those brands are Woolworths and Capitec.Woolworths rose to the top as one of the year’s most “meaningfully different” brands, which makes a difference to consumers by meeting their functional and emotional needs to create affinity; while also creating a difference by being perceived as distinctive, giving them a competitive edge. They drive strong brand purpose, offer a unique brand experience and amplify this through great market communication. Woolworth’s also received a special award for best brand experience overall.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452396-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Woolworths trials recycling vending machine in Cape Town store" width="120" height="120">Woolworths trials recycling vending machine in Cape Town storeIn an effort to reduce packaging waste, Woolworths is piloting an integrated reverse vending machine in its flagship green store, Woolworths Palmyra in Claremont...8 Aug 2018Capitec bank was named this year’s most innovative brand. Capitec adopted technological disruption to distinguish themselves from competitors through biometric security, but there’s more to it than that.Powering CX with technologyIn a panel discussion following the keynote presentations of the morning, Kantar TNS South Africa CEO Ivan Moroke spoke about the power of technology with panellists Francois Viviers, marketing and communications executive at Capitec; as well as Charlene Van Zyl, head of customer at Woolworths; Tshego Tshukutswane, director at Kantar; and Eric Salama, Kantar’s global CEO.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1801/427048.jpg" alt="Kantar TNS announces new CEO in South Africa" width="120" height="120">Kantar TNS announces new CEO in South AfricaIvan Moroke has been appointed as CEO, Kantar TNS, South Africa. He will take up his position officially from 1 February 2018...Issued by Kantar TNS 29 Jan 2018On innovative banking, Viviers said, “if you can go to Woolworths on a Sunday, you should be able to do your banking then, too.” That’s what you get from Capitec. Another standout factor is that they got rid of the extensive security required to just enter most banks, as well as those confusing queues that often lead to the wrong banking department.In addition:Poor people really need good value, and those who have money want a bargain. That’s why there’s only one banking option at Capitec, it’s not tiered based on earnings.Capitec continues to prove its value by disrupting from what people expect of the industry. Their #RethinkCredit ad offers helpful advice most us don’t get elsewhere, instead of the beautiful vignettes capped by a banking logo, which could belong to any financial institution.On using tech for experience, Van Zyl opened by asking if you’ve ever noticed that your local Woolies is always cold, even if you’re nowhere near the freezers. The reason is that temperature control is linked to quality. You’re unconsciously thinking the food is fresher as it’s being kept chilly.Why we love WooliesVan Zyl added that brand experience is becoming more than consistency when you go into a branch of a well-known brand. At Woolworths, they’re using technology to understand customers’ shifting needs, and then adjust what’s offered per store.In retail, particularly online, you need to understand what your customers browse for and how they browse so that you don’t repeatedly show pictures of juicy, raw steaks to vegetarians. But there is a fine line between stalking and being intimate.Van Zyl added that the role of marketing isn’t as clean-cut as it used to be. Brand building of today needs a cross-functioning team, and we need disruption in the way most companies are organised functionally in silos. Business just doesn’t happen along those staid, well-work pathways anymore.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/454920.png" alt="Unsilo.me is simplifying the way your business works" width="120" height="120">Unsilo.me is simplifying the way your business worksYou know when you just want simplicity for your business, one solution to manage all your sales, ongoing work, schedule and employees.

The context of cultureShe also pointed out that distinctiveness doesn’t just happen. You need a capable marketing team, with a wide-lens view of the market, to turn that understanding of the market into what you offer your customers. You then need to articulate the value you add, and communicate it clearly. Tshukutswane says, “be courageous and stay the course.”On what SA marketers should leverage more - with his outside-in view, Salama said he went onto the Nando’s South Africa website and didn’t understand the bulk of the content.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459239-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nando's responds to that fake 'azishe' poster" width="120" height="120">Nando's responds to that fake 'azishe' posterWhile Nando's appreciates the enthusiasm of fans who create ads in support of the brand, they say you've got to make sure it's fired up!...20 Sep 2018That’s a good thing as it proves it’s relevant, contextual and correct for the local market. Salama added that local brands are growing at the expense of global brands, as they just don’t have that agility and cultural relevance that Tshukutswane highlighted.  Salama added that tech and data are enablers to create those strong relationships between the brand and the customer, and that they lead to deeper human understanding for the brand, in all their diversity.But execution is the area where great brands live and die. Brands know what they need to do in theory, but often aren’t brave enough to do it.Salama also echoed Van Zyl’s point that we need to step away from the siloed businesses we have built. The benefits of being 'same-same, but different'We need conflict and diversity of opinion to challenge group norms because the truly deep insights don’t look from looking at the averages but from the outliers and what’s easy to miss on the margins; from what’s small yet growing. So when people talk of innovation and communication, brands need to realise that it’s just not effective without a diverse workforce.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449892-120x120.png?2" alt="Makhathini in action at Kantar Millward Brown's offices in the Foreshore." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Unboxing diversity in advertising'Thinking outside the box' is a good way to improve your creativity skills.

In addition, we need to turn insights from something fluffy into something based on true monetary value, to create credible conversations and overall customer experiences.Viviers concluded that brands will not survive if the marketing strategy is not tied to the business strategy.Click through to the Kantar Millward Brown press office and follow their brand and the #BrandZSA hashtag on Twitter for the latest updates.Read more<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/445667.jpg" alt="Any brand can create disruption to fuel growth according to a new report from Kantar Millward Brown" width="120" height="120">Any brand can create disruption to fuel growth according to a new report from Kantar Millward BrownRecent analysis of the BrandZ global database shows many brands aren't seizing opportunities to disrupt with fewer than one in 10 brands growing between 2014 and 2017...Issued by Kantar Millward Brown 20 Jun 2018<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/466585.jpg" alt="First ever South African BrandZ ranking reveals growth potential for local brands" width="120" height="120">First ever South African BrandZ ranking reveals growth potential for local brandsThe report, released today by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown, reveals that the Top 30 South African brands show more potential for global growth than their counterparts in the Chinese and European rankings, but have less exposure to overseas markets...Issued by Kantar Millward Brown 31 Oct 2018
