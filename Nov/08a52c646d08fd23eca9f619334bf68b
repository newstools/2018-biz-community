All entries were loaded onto the Bic website with the public voting for the top 20 finalists. The final three winners were selected by a Bic judging panel.The Bic Art Master talent search is an annual competition encouraging artists to create artwork using Bic stationery. Mlangeni said he has always worked with Bic pens and coloured pencils. “They were all I could afford while growing up, so it suited me, I was working with the equipment that I always had,” he said.His passion for art started at a young ageMlangeni’s passion for art started at a very young age. He was orphaned by the age of six and was brought up by his grandmother in Zamdela township, Sasolburg, along with his brother and 10 cousins.While at primary school, he used to watch Dragon Ball Z, a Japanese animation series, and draw all the characters. His grandmother would tell him to stop drawing and focus on his school work, but as he got older she realised that he had a genuine talent and encouraged his art. She is 75 now and retired, but she worked her entire life as a dress designer and seamstress and Ennock believes he inherited his artistic ability and flair from her. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470491.jpg" alt="Ennock Mlangeni wins 2018 Bic Art Master competition" width="600" height="368" rel="/c/1811/470492.jpg?0" data-height="368" data-lwidth="1287" data-lheight="900" class="gflipper-image" align="center">© Ennock Mlangeni.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470493.jpg" alt="Ennock Mlangeni wins 2018 Bic Art Master competition" width="600" height="349" rel="/c/1811/470494.jpg?0" data-height="349" data-lwidth="1521" data-lheight="900" class="gflipper-image" align="center">© Ennock Mlangeni.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470495.jpg" alt="Ennock Mlangeni wins 2018 Bic Art Master competition" width="600" height="355" rel="/c/1811/470496.jpg?0" data-height="355" data-lwidth="1584" data-lheight="900" class="gflipper-image" align="center">© Ennock Mlangeni.He attended the local school, Nkgopoleng High, where art was not offered as a subject, but this did not stop his enthusiasm. “The school recognised my ability to draw and encouraged me to enter the local Science Exhibition where I won first prize in the art section in grades 10, 11 and 12.
