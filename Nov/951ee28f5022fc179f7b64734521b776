Whether women are being active by running around the park pushing their child in a pram, hula-hooping at home, jumping into the sea, trampolining with friends or teaching themselves how to swim using YouTube, the message of “This Girl Can” is that all exercise counts. Watch the spot here, featuring Barbra Streisand’s “Don’t Rain On My Parade”: https://vimeo.com/297280078.
