We got in touch with Ash to find out more.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469728-625x417.jpg" alt="Ash Heeger chats about Netflix cooking show The Final Table" width="625" height="417">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you prepare for a cooking show like The Final Table, can one prepare?It’s impossible to prepare for something when you have no idea what it is you’re in for. When I flew to Los Angeles, I still had no idea what the format of the competition would even be..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us what The Final Table is about and your role on the show?My “role” on the show was like everyone else’s. We, the contestants, were individually selected from around the world to compete in the most extreme cooking competition the world has seen thus far.Over 10 episodes on The Final Table, myself and 23 other chefs cook the national dish from a specific country, starting with Mexico. Those who land in the bottom of the national dish challenge are forced to cook for one of the most respected chefs of that country to stay in the competition..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you come to be on the show?I was head-hunted by Netflix..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was the response like to your cooking on the show?You’ll have to wait and see..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you handle the pressure?I’ve lived under immense pressure my entire career. This experience was no different. It’s easy to forget that after filming the show would appear on Netflix. It was just about the cooking..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Which of the judges were you most excited to meet?All of the judges are demi-gods in my opinion. I was particularly excited to meet Enrique Elvera. He is right up there for me.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469740-625x416.png" alt="Ash Heeger chats about Netflix cooking show The Final Table" width="625" height="416">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are your thoughts on cooking shows and the cult of the celebrity chef?I think the “celebrity chef cult” is nonsense. Any chef worth their salt doesn’t care about how much airtime or followers they have. It should be about food and nothing else..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Are you watching any cooking shows on Netflix right now? Like I said I prefer to watch something else after busting my chops all day. I’m a fan of Chef’s Table, Ugly Delicious, No Reservations and Mind of a Chef.  My guilty pleasure to watch on Netflix is far too embarrassing to say out loud, so I’ll just keep that one to myself..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How would you describe your style of cooking?Modern and playful. It’s a bit of me and my journey so far on a plate. I don’t fit comfortably into any box, nor do I think I should. My style is a little French, a little Asian, a little South African.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469741-625x416.png" alt="Ash Heeger chats about Netflix cooking show The Final Table" width="625" height="416">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What would be your ultimate guilty pleasure when it comes to food?Oh, wow. I have a lot of guilty pleasures. Fat being the most revolting I think. I could just eat fat all day. Any animal. I’ll take it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}If you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life what would it be?Fat. Kidding. Probably cheeseburgers to be honest. I am such a sucker for a burger.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469739-625x416.png" alt="Ash Heeger chats about Netflix cooking show The Final Table" width="625" height="416">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Your favourite food memory?Too many to pick from I’m afraid! If I had to relive a single meal, it would be sitting on a tiny pink plastic chair in the middle of Ho Chi Minh City. It was one of the most delicious meals I have ever had the pleasure of eating and possibly one of the most simple. The place is called Quan An Co Lieng..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What would you be doing if you weren’t a chef?I haven’t a clue. I’ve never so much as given it a moment of thought before. I decided I wanted to be a chef when I was nine. Probably something high octane. Something in law enforcement maybe?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What would be your top food trends for 2019?Seeing chefs sourcing local and sustainable produce and supporting small local communities should be the trendiest trend of 2019..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Is there any food trend or fad that you are not a fan of?I don’t really buy into any food trend, to be honest..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Favourite emoji?I use the shaka emoji the most I reckon.For more go to www.netflix.com/thefinaltable.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
