Johnnie Walker and Techsys stand for innovation, so we wanted to honour that with our approach,” explains senior e-CRM strategist Bronwyn Jack. “We know South African consumers love WhatsApp, and we’ve been working on chatbots for a while. By marrying the two we could provide an opportunity for participants at Whisky Live to experience a top-class competition by interacting with the Johnnie Walker bot.”The Techsys Digital chatbot platform enables brand polls, loyalty campaigns, instant rewards, and on-pack competitions to name a few of its most popular features.Techsys MD Andrew Walmsley says, “We are excited to be one of the first agencies in South Africa to enable the use of a WhatsApp Bot as a key digital touchpoint in our campaigns. It’s going to be very exciting to see what we can deliver for leading brands like Johnnie Walker and the broader Diageo brand portfolio.”
