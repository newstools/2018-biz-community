In recent years the organisation has seen massive growth and now boasts membership in 86 countries. As marketing and communications budgets are being cut across the world it is becoming crucial that communicators measure and evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns. Measurement Month is filled with events, the majority of them free, including webinars, breakfast briefings, conferences, workshops, podcasts and much more, focusing on filling the gap between understanding the value of PR measurement and doing something about it. AMEC members organise events across the globe as part of AMEC’s Global Education Program.The AMEC Integrated Evaluation Framework, launched in 2016, guides communicators through the best measurement practices process and is already available in 21 languages – from English, French, Spanish, German and Russian through to Chinese and Arabic. The Framework, a free online resource, has seen great adoption across the globe as it demystifies best measurement and evaluation practices."This Framework makes sense of the complexities of working across Paid, Earned, Shared and Owned (PESO) channels and shows how to shift the emphasis of evaluation from counting outputs to proving value via the critical outtakes, outcomes and organisational impact of our work," says Richard Bagnall, AMEC Chairman.AMEC is also busy developing the Measurement Maturity Mapper – announced during its global summit held in June 2018 in Barcelona. This tool will assist organisations to benchmark their progress towards best measurement practices and evaluate the current level and effectiveness of their measurement activities.Ornico, the media intelligence company, will host a free Measurement Month breakfast workshop on Friday, 23 November 2018 in Johannesburg. The discussions will include the Barcelona Principles 2.0, The Integrated Evaluation Framework, the launch of the Measurement Maturity Mapper, global trends and will also feature various case studies of best practices from across the world.Communicators are also encouraged to follow #AMECMM on social media during November 2018 to join thousands of global colleagues who are learning and working to better the public relations industry.For more information on global events visit https://amecorg.com/measurement-month-2018/measurement-month-events-2018/For further information to attend the Ornico Johannesburg workshop please email: francoisv@ornicogroup.co.zabRev('brev-b338b510-0578-45c0-9145-93311dc5206b', '>a/\<az.oc.puorgocinro@vsiocnarf>"az.oc.puorgocinro;46#&vsiocnarf:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
