Especially if you’re one of the elite few working for what’s long been regarded as the fourth estate –  the media.No-one said the life of a media worker would be easy, but it's an especially stressful day job in Africa. Not only do you need to multitask like a pro and dash from pillar to post, but reporting on reality means your life is often at stake – quite literally.And that’s here in SA, where we’ve got it relatively good’.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/407833-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nicolaides, Mortlock and Lindeque in action." width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: Inside the truth of the female-strong EWN newsroomYour worst nightmares often form the harsh realities of daily work life for the females in Primedia Broadcasting's EWN newsroom.

And there are stacks of flavour in the voices reporting on our reality.That’s why Allie counts their future success as lying in their approach that’s similar to what’s being done in the talk radio space: Asking questions, providing insights and encouraging viewers to do the same by sending in WhatsApp notes, and videos, and ‘Saturday braai’ opinions. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/467639-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Open News MD, Nisa Allie." width="120" height="120">How to launch an independent TV news channel like Open NewseMedia Investments launched Open News on Thursday, 1 November.

Freedom of expression and the need to protect reportersWith the end of apartheid in 1994 however, censorship ended thanks to the new constitution Allie refers to, as well as the Bill of Rights that guarantees that every citizen has the right to freedom of expression.That includes freedom of the press and media, the freedom to receive or impart information or ideas, freedom of artistic creativity, academic freedom, and freedom of scientific research.As these freedoms are generally respected, our press is considered relatively free, with “little evidence of repressive measures against journalists”. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/435826-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The World Press Freedom Index 2017 by ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Grave press freedom violations in AfricaFreedom of speech, long seen as a mainstay of the Western world, isn't necessarily a given elsewhere, especially when you criticise government policy and work in the media...By Leigh Andrews 9 Apr 2018But just because our own media is free and fair, doesn’t mean we’re protected when reporting from the rest of the globe.Africa editor Louise Marsland reported last week: A late night SOS on Facebook alerted friends, colleagues and her employers, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which lobbies for press freedom around the world, that media activist and former South African journalist and editor, Angela Quintal, and her colleague, Muthoki Mumo, were being taken away for interrogation from their hotel in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/467772.jpg" alt="Media activist Angela Quintal reported to be safe" width="120" height="120">Media activist Angela Quintal reported to be safeMedia activist and former South African journalist and editor, Angela Quintal, has been interrogated in Tanzania...By Louise Marsland 8 Nov 2018Luckily, the two were returned to their hotel unharmed, and have since had their passports returned. According to Daily Maverick, press freedom is threatened by President John Magufuli’s regime in Tanzania. Journalists have disappeared while others face suspensions, threats of violence, arrests and bans. Newspapers have been forcibly shut down. And the realm of digital publishing is clearly a concern, with the CPJ confirming a false tweet was sent from Quintal's personal Twitter account, with repeated attempts made to access Quintal's email. This brings to mind the Khashoggi murder case, where Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared on entering the Saudi consulate.Tech making it harder to kill the storyThe tragic case highlighted the role of the media as the fourth estate, as well as the fact that killing the journalist does not necessarily mean you've killed the story – especially with the ease of access to social media meaning traditional media lines are blurred.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465157-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Why the Khashoggi murder mystery has dominated news headlines" width="120" height="120">Why the Khashoggi murder mystery has dominated news headlinesWith fake news at an all-time high and trust in the media at an all-time low, the Khashoggi murder case highlights the role of the media as the fourth estate, as killing the journalist does not necessarily mean you've killed the story...By Leigh Andrews 25 Oct 2018In fact, with the first anniversary of Maltese investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia's assassination by car bomb just behind us, the importance of media freedom is first and foremost.Marcus Brewster reports that Galizia’s death inspired a new the Onion Router – it’s a cloud-based system using the anonymous Tor network, that allows journalists and other organisations to establish a trusted grid of storage points within the wider network to then upload and download files using a simple web app. The users that compose a trusted grid each share the responsibility of storing incomplete pieces of each other’s encrypted files with zero knowledge of how many other parts there are, which peers are storing them, or how to read their contents…Once tested we can work with journalists to implement the tech and give these heroes another layer of security, another tool to help them do their work.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/466769-120x120.jpg" alt="A South African's guide to moving to and making it in Malta: When Daphne met Dropbox" width="120" height="120">A South African's guide to moving to and making it in Malta: When Daphne met DropboxFor a nation-state marked in the recent past by the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia on an island that is positioning itself as the future blockchain capital of the world, it was inevitable that both these strands would come together at some point...By Marcus 'The Maltese Falcon' Brewster 2 Nov 2018We all need to join the fight for media freedom.
