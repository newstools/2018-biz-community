Accolades were awarded to those recruitment agencies, big and small, that stood out for the level of service they provided to job seekers who used CareerJunction to find employment. What makes this event so unique is that award winners are determined by job seekers, who get to cast their votes throughout the course of the year. Paul Byrne, CareerJunction’s Managing Director said: “This is the 15th year that we host the RecruiterAwards. Recruiting talent online has become the norm and it’s important that we maintain best practices in the industry and continue to set high standards when it comes to assisting job seekers with finding jobs. We always endeavour to make the user journey from job search to placement as elegant as possible and we won’t be able to do it without the help of recruitment agencies. CareerJunction’s RecruiterAwards is, for this reason, an important event for us to recognise clients that have gone above and beyond.” This year, over 3,000 votes were cast, and nine agencies walked away with special accolades for their contributions during 2018. Awards were presented across three categories (based on the number of jobs posted over the past 12-month period): Platinum 100 (advertised an average of 71 to 100 job ads per month).  Platinum 70 (advertised an average of 26 to 70 job ads per month).  Platinum 25 (advertised an average of 10 to 25 job ads per month).And the winners and finalists across these three categories were:<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470792.png" alt="2018 RecruiterAwards - Top recruiters announced" width="625" height="378">Paul Byrne presented the awards.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/470793.png" alt="2018 RecruiterAwards - Top recruiters announced" width="625" height="313">From left to right: Taryn Lipman (101 Careers), Paul Byrne (CareerJunction), Janine Azevedo (Sinakho Staffshop), Ntsundu Hokwane (Sinakho Staffshop), Gaye Lowe-Martin (CareerJunction) and Jo-Anne Macris (Abantu Resources).
