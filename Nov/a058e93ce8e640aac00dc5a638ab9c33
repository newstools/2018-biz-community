An exclusive partnership, these two stations are the very first local stations that South African users can enjoy on Deezer.The partnership comes at a time when radio stations across the world are diversifying to attract new audiences, and what better way to pique this interest than to offer radio content on the mobile devices that we all carry around in our pockets every day.To stream Jacaranda FM and East Coast Radio, users can simply log on to their Deezer profile and click through to either radio station in the ‘Deezer Recommends’ section of their homepage.The Live radio feature however, will soon have its own channel, which will display popular radio stations by category, such as music, talk and international. Users will be able to access a selection of radio stations through the Deezer homepage (on mobile or desktop), select Browse and then find their preferred Live radio channel.Station General Manager Boni Mchunu says “East Coast Radio is widely recognized as KZN’s number one hit music station and through this partnership we will reach an even wider audience, beyond the borders of our home province. We know that there are lots of fans who will be delighted to get closer to ‘home’ by tuning into ECR through Deezer.”“Deezer is continuously improving its user experience by introducing relevant new features, which allows users to have a more rich and varied experience.  Music lovers in South Africa now have the option to listen to their Flow, stream their favourite artists and listen to the hottest playlists, as well as access their favourite local radio shows.  We are very excited to launch with Jacaranda and ECR, two of South Africa’s most loved stations” says Gillian Ezra, Head of Operations for Africa at Deezer.Currently, only Jacaranda FM and East Coast Radio is available to all Deezer users in South Africa, with more expected in the coming future.
