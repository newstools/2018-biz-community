Almost all the ideas she liked had already been snatched up as domain names. Then a friend suggested Tech Girl, which Wright shot down as she didn’t like it… but the domain was available, and she was so frustrated with the process that she bought the domain and decided to roll with it. Roll with it she has, as the name stuck and has proven so effective that she’s also changed her gamer tag and social media to Tech Girl.        View this post on Instagram           2017 has been one hell of a year for me. Dreams have come true, goals have been smashed, new places have been experienced & tears have been shed. It’s been hard, it’s been painful and it has also been glorious. Couldn’t have done it without you. Which was your fav Tech Girl moment this year? I also have a full year in review blog post up if you’d like to read it. #linkinbio #2017bestnine A post shared by  Sam "Tech Girl" Wright (@techgirlza) on Dec 28, 2017 at 11:57pm PST The name probably sounds familiar as Wright hosted one of the biggest Overwatch tournaments globally earlier this year and are well known as an MC and commentator in this niche industry. She’s also the Razer brand ambassador for SA, a content creator for 5FM’s #GamerGlitch, and the South African esports contributor for Red Bull. Such is the varied life of an entrepreneur!Here, she shares how she got involved in esports, what her day-to-day work in the industry entails, and tips for anyone looking to follow in your footsteps and make a career of their passions this #EntrepreneurMonth….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Let’s start with the basics. How did you get involved in esports?My brother played competitive Dota 2 for many years. He got me into the scene and I used to go to watch him regularly. He eventually retired but I was still documenting South African esports regardless, as we both enjoyed watching the action. I became frustrated when local gaming media wasn't covering the events or highlighting local players so I decided to make my own content! I started writing blog posts and doing videos about local SA esports events and players. A good friend who now works with ESL in Europe then suggested I try hosting and casting.At the time I fobbed him off, but he started planting the seed with local organisations before giving me my first hosting job, which was the Evetech Champion's League event in 2016. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1712/423644-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Samantha Wright, content producer at Tech Girl." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: Death to the influencer - a shift in word-of-mouth marketingInfluencer. The dirty word of 2017. It's interesting how the landscape shifts so quickly and in such a short period of time...By Samantha Wright 8 Jan 2018Before I hosted this event, the then-Telkom DGL had reached out to me to do content around their Masters series and host their finals. So both the organisation and individual played a role in getting me "work". But my brother really needs to be credited with fueling the passion from the get-go. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love the family inspo. Looking at the work itself, how does marketing to a gaming audience differ from traditional marketing to consumers? Gaming audiences don't have time for BS! They're tech savvy and know what they want. Gamers also tend to be fussy about purchases – they’re willing to spend, but only if they're 100% sure that what they're spending their cash on is good quality.

Limited stock available once they’re gone they’re gone! ������ A post shared by  Sam "Tech Girl" Wright (@techgirlza) on Oct 4, 2018 at 2:21am PDT So there’s no space to be disingenuous or shove marketing speak down their throats. You need to be honest and open in how you position and market your products or services to them. I like the very real and raw nature of the audience, as it really allows for brands to find creative new strategies that truly speak to their core sale points..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Take us behind the scenes on what it takes to produce your behind-the-scenes vlogs of events, live-streams gameplay, and interviews with popular gaming personalities. A lot of sleepless nights! Much of the content I produce for my own channels has to be done over and above "work". For example, I love to do behind-the-scenes vlogs of events I'm working on, but the event itself takes precedence. So when everyone breaks for lunch I'm quickly trying to film a few shots or showcase a rehearsal. It comes down to a lot of time management. Finding cool storylines and showcasing the player stories, which is really where my passion lies, requires me to also build relationships with said players so that they trust me and know that I'll attempt to do their stories justice with my content.Live streams are a bit different.         View this post on Instagram           Prepping for live #esports broadcasts gets me hella nervous. My top tip? Chewing gum #40min before. Warms up the jaw and forces you to BREATHE! Works every time ���� #CloretsSA #sponsored A post shared by  Sam "Tech Girl" Wright (@techgirlza) on Jun 25, 2018 at 7:08am PDT They usually take an hour to prep and set up, and then I play a game for an hour while chatting to my audience who watch me play live. My live streams are a passion project that I do to showcase that anyone, no matter their level or experience, can have fun gaming. I struggle to learn mechanics in new games, despite this being my job, and it takes me time, so I wanted to show this as a way to give other gamers or potential gamers who might be nervous about their skill level, the confidence to just pick up the controller..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love it. Let’s end with some tips for anyone looking to follow in your footsteps and make a career of their passions this #EntrepreneurMonth. Whether you want to be a live streamer or esports host, you just need to start! Lots of people expect payment right out the gate and don't want to create content without reimbursement. It doesn't work that way. If you're passionate, you need to do what I did and just start making that content, showcasing the stories you want to tell and getting the stuff out there.

This week we’re going Lara Croft mad - 2 vids dropping of my time behind the scenes. So excited to share with you! #tombraidermovie #wbsponsored A post shared by  Sam "Tech Girl" Wright (@techgirlza) on Mar 3, 2018 at 12:46am PST It is tough in the beginning and, again, requires some time management, but it is worth it. There are a lot of esports websites that also provide suggestions and tips for getting started in broadcast, I'd suggest reading all of them. It can take years before you start getting hired for gigs so it’s important to not get into this for the money, or else you might be disappointed. It needs to come from a place of love for gaming and the culture it has cultivated.Inspiring words for anyone looking to turn their passion into their day job as we kick off #EntrepreneurMonth.
