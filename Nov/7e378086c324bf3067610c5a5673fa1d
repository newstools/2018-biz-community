Since 2018, startup residents at the campus have relished the opportunity to engage with various in-house support teams, build and polish their products, network and access various markets. Of the initial 87 selected, 67 remain, boasting combined revenue of over USD7 million and employing around 250 staff. Jodie Ellinor-Dreyer, from Fortress REIT Limited, said “This is just the start. We hope to drive change and support more emerging businesses and the youth in their quest to grow. We look forward to a long and sustainable partnership with 22 on Sloane.”The current 67 startups operate in diverse sectors with 70% of them leading great technology initiatives that spans across various sectors. Twenty-five of the current 67 residents from diverse economic sectors were selected to receive a seed grant of up to R50,000 each from Fortress REIT Limited. They received this grant during the much-anticipated Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW), that took place from the 12 to 18 November 2018. The annual GEW is a highlight on any entrepreneur’s calendar. It’s a celebration of innovators and job creators who launch startups that bring ideas to life, drive economic growth and expand human welfare. The week-long event, held every November, inspires people everywhere through local, national and global activities, designed to help them explore their potential as self-starters and innovators. These activities range from large-scale competitions and events to intimate network gatherings, which connect participants to potential collaborators, mentors and even investors – introducing them to new possibilities and exciting opportunities. GEW is supported by dozens of world leaders and a network of more than 15,000 partner organisations. Over nine million people participate in GEW activities globally. The Global Entrepreneurship Network Africa encourages various ecosystem partners to host GEW events in their communities and cities and seek partnerships from public and private sector stakeholders to support their activities. This year, various South Africa ecosystem role players hosted more than 200 events across the country with a combined attendance of more than 20,000 people and 22 on Sloane also hosted its own activities. Kizito Okechukwu, Co-Chair of GEN Africa, thanked all partners for supporting 22 on Sloane, as well as those that champion other events within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. “For us, developing and supporting startups should remain our lifeblood; we should celebrate GEW every day and we urge other stakeholders to do the same,” he said. For the 2019 Residency Programme, startups in the following sectors are encouraged to apply for residency: agriculture/agro-processing, e-commerce, edu-tech, fin-tech, gaming, health, renewable energy, robotics, transport and manufacturing.
