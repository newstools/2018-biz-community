Can I come maybe give it to you so you have a model of what phones might be critical for honourable Cabinet members?” Ndlozi added, making reference to Gigaba’s leaked sex tape.Gigaba, not amused, responded with this.Gigaba later apologised, suggesting that the gesture indeed played into a discourse of toxic masculinity. Basically, yes. Parliament has devolved into a literal dick measuring contest.“I apologise, unreservedly, for this gesture. The petty taunts that provoked it and the strain I have been taking, over the past 10 days, are no excuse for my indiscretion,” he tweeted.People aren’t buying it though.While others were asking the real questions.
