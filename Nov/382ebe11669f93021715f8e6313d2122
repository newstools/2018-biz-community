And it is from those experiences that she developed the popular YouTube series titled ‘Cover, Girl’, which offers styling tips and advice for women of any faith wanting to dress modestly or conservatively yet still remain highly fashionable and on-trend. While I am not in hijab, I felt I wanted to cover my body more, and as someone who really loves fashion that was really hard at first. But now I love and embrace my style, and through this series, I aim to help other women who are starting to cover up to feel the same way. There isn’t nearly enough content online for the girls ‘in the middle’, so to speak, and I wanted to change that. Despite being so niche, it hasn’t held me back in any way and my followers equally consist of modest-dressers and women with an unrestricted sense of style.Here, Harron-Ally shares how blogging, in general, has changed since she started her own blog in 2010 and how she manages to keep her content fresh and relevant..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us more about yourself.

I do miss writing more frequently on my blog, which I don't think I'll give up on, but today people want to see and watch more than they want to read..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How do you keep your content fresh and relevant? I try to find a balance between what people want and how I can add value to their lives. I also look at what's trending and see what I feel like doing or whatever is inspiring me. I ask myself questions around the criteria often when I'm creating, and that's what directs me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has been the most memorable campaign to date that you have been involved in?
