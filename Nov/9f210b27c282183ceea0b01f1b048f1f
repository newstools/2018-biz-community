As they will probably not be able to afford a marketing agency or full-time marketing manager (at first) to communicate their brand message to the public, they will need to do this themselves. This means that they will need a thorough knowledge of marketing in a digital context.”The explosion of reputable online marketing education providers is good news for entrepreneurs whose schedules are often very erratic and are unable to make set class times. With online learning, entrepreneurs can learn what they need to about marketing when its convenient for them.
