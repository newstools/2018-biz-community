It’s tougher than you might thinkThe biggest misconception about entrepreneurship is that it’s a quick-fix solution to financial struggles. If you’re starting on the backfoot with debt to your name or little to no cash in the bank, the cost of starting a business will more than likely take you into deeper financial strain. Ensure your personal finances are tied up and well-managed, and that you have a business plan that’s been looked at by an expert, business advisor or even someone close to you. You probably won’t be profitable for the first few yearsOwning a business isn’t the least bit easier than working a regular job. For one thing, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be taking home much of a salary at the end of every month, especially in the beginning. In fact, many entrepreneurs dip into their personal savings to make ends meet at first.   Work = lifeSomeone starting up a business should not take for granted the amount of free time you will, or will not, have. Striking a work-life balance is difficult in the beginning, especially when the success of the business and its employees is your responsibility. However, implementing automated systems and hiring dedicated staff to take care of some business elements can give an entrepreneur the opportunity to strike a balance and dedicate more time to loved ones and hobbies. There will be days when you want to quitOver and above the hardships start-up businesses face on their own, you should also consider the tough economy. Many entrepreneurs reach a point where calling it quits seems like the only option. Taking the risks and making mistakes becomes the gateway to building your entrepreneurial style and developing character. But entrepreneurship isn’t all doom and gloomBeing an entrepreneur takes immense mental, emotional and spiritual strength, especially in the starting phase. While everyone might not have the strength to persevere, that doesn’t mean they can’t attain their full potential with the right training, mentorship and tolerance level. It’s tough out there, which is why it’s so important to make sure you’re passionate about what you’re doing, and that you’re doing it for the right reasons.
