It was Joe Public, the group’s newly digitised above-the-line agency with its powerful campaigns for Castle Milk Stout and Chicken Licken that led the charge across a wide range of categories winning 10 Gold, five Silver and seven Craft Certificates. Joe Public Shift, the group’s branding and design unit brought home six awards including five Golds. Having recently received the prestigious title of Agency of the Year at the 2018 Loerie Awards, Joe Public really popped the corks on acceptance of the coveted Pendoring Umpetha Award. A highly respected honour, the Umpetha is presented to the best advertisement in an indigenous language, excluding Afrikaans. It was the beautifully crafted piece, “#GetItBack”, for Castle Milk Stout that truly encapsulated the spirit of the award, trumping the Integrated Campaign category.“We are extremely proud of our creative talent at Joe Public. Our diverse, dedicated people are invested, heart and soul, in what they do. They are driven to create work that is relevant, work that belongs to our country – a country that has long since been seen as a pivotal player in the international award circuits. Together with our clients, we believe creativity is about stretching your mind to make magic. When we see locally inspired work rising to the top, we know that magic is doing what it should – inspiring a nation to think beyond,” said Xolisa Dyeshana, Chief Creative Officer, Joe Public. Joe Public proudly sits at the top of this year’s Pendorings creative table and is steadfast in their belief that excellence exponentially breeds great creativity, which ultimately grows our clients.
