The ‘millennials’ memes are everywhere, and we’ve all enjoyed the odd chuckle at these ‘crazy kids’, with criticisms couched in the vaguest and most generic of terms – ‘lazy’, ‘disrespectful’, ‘entitled’. The challenge then, for growth-seeking businesses and corporate leaders, is to separate the stereotypical nonsense from the facts, and ensure that their internal processes are geared to embracing the opportunities that engaging with Generation Now present.‘millennials will constitute 75% of the workforce by 2025’ According to projections by former Telefonica UK Chief Executive Ronan Dunne, speaking at Microsoft’s Future Decoded event in 2014, the UK alone will need almost one million additional emerging technology-skilled workers by 2019, and millennials will constitute 75% of the global workforce by 2025. In 2018 and beyond, the question of whether to actively engineer corporate environments to attract and retain ‘young’ talent is moot, as yesterday’s youth are in fact today’s most valuable intrapreneurial resource. The ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ is no longer theoretical, and businesses that neglect to connect with Generation Now will, almost by definition, become redundant. In today’s ever-changing corporate environment, corporates can no longer take sustainable ‘relevance’ for granted, as best-practice processes and expectations evolve almost daily. To fully realise and exploit this new reality, businesses absolutely must attract and retain Generation Now candidates strategically, and with purposeful intention. The temptation of course, is to ‘box-tick’ by simply filling new or entry-level vacancies with younger applicants and calling it a day. Research has shown, however, that Generation Now insists upon tangible value from their employer relationships, and a generic approach to human resource processes will fail to attract and retain young talent. It is incumbent for all businesses seriously invested in growth, to follow an intentional, defined process in order to identify exactly how tapping into Generation Now will add to your corporate portfolio of efficiencies. Defining Generation Now. Generation Now includes millennials, and post-millennials. Their birth dates typically include the mid-90s to mid-00s as a referential benchmark.  They are defined, in a very literal sense, by Connectivity. Corporates would do well to realise that for Generation Now technology, and access to technology, is not an ‘either/or’ proposition, but a defining feature of ‘self’. Locally, while a statistically relevant segment of this demographic may not be connected 24/7, this is almost always due to a lack of access, and not a lack of desire. While technical sophistication should not be assumed as given, Generation Now’s immersion in the ‘Internet of Things’, means that they are fluent in the ‘language’, and possess the skills to quickly and efficiently adopt and apply innovative and disruptive concepts. Generation Now will comprise the vast majority of emerging commercial markets. This demographic is the most valued market segment for businesses and employers. As mentioned above, a business cannot ‘sell’ unless it speaks the ‘language’. Ensuring ‘back-end’ corporate policy as well as ‘front-end’ commercial strategy is geared to consider and action Generation Now imperatives will determine whether innovation, in specific contexts, goes beyond ‘corporate speak’ and is designed to extract the most tangible value from your workforce. Locally, Generation Now insists on personal and professional empowerment solutions. High-end Generation Now candidates understand very well, the fickle nature of today’s skills market. Life-long learning is considered not an option, but a basic requirement for personal and professional advancement. Companies that neglect to overtly offer access to employee improvement opportunities are disconnected from internal growth possibilities and intrapreneurial innovation potential, rendering themselves unattractive to Generation Now, who insists upon environments in which their potential can be recognised, nurtured and fulfilled. Traditional concepts of corporate ‘loyalty’ no longer apply, as Generation Now is more than willing to search out better opportunities. To retain and maximise talent output, companies need to understand and embrace the processes for, and implications of, creating value for their workforce, which in the Generation Now context, means recognising their priorities and actively seeking to meet them. Generational juxtapositions are often involved, and almost by definition, difficult. Merging divergent workplace perspectives though, will for the foreseeable future, be one of the cornerstones of successful business management. Corporate leaders who successfully manage this transition from traditional, hierarchy-driven ‘best-practice’ process to an inclusive, future-looking focus will better position themselves to exploit future markets, future process and future growth.
