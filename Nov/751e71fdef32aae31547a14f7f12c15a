Therefore, we need to think differently about our brands and categories and what the point of leverage is that will give us more than a marginal growth one year to be lost the next,” he says. Brands need to grow their differentiation excessively, so they stand out in their category and are noticed by others outside of their category. “Disruptors are seen as hugely different to their competitors and they change the way a category works,” he says.There are three reasons why a brand needs to be different: It allows people to choose in a sea of choice. It gives the brand pricing power. You cannot command a premium if you not seen as different.If a consumer can easily vocalise why they bought a brand, then they are more satisfied with their choice. It is up to marketers to give them an easy rational why they bought a product. Amazon changed the electrical goods category 24 years ago. Amazon is perceived to be different to others in its category and it is a brand that creates value for consumers. Hence its success he says. “However, while differentiation is essential for growth, real winners do not think about that; instead they think about how they can disrupt and change things to be in favour of their brand,” he says. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/467406-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How brands can win in the digital era" width="120" height="120">How brands can win in the digital eraWe are entering the digital era.

From 2015 to 2017 its growth slowed. It needed to reach new buyers and an audience wider than yoga. “Their challenge was to make themselves more purposeful. They used their first advert to do this by reframing what yoga stands for by reaching out to people other than yoga practitioners, but with a similar mindset. The advertisement led to their sales increasing 20% year on year,” he says. “This stems from a deep understanding of who their target audience is and the similarities between them and their potential target audience. We need to be disruptive and to find something to shake up the category. While communication is a quick way to do this, you must amplify it to reach consumers not yet in your target market.”He gives three areas brands should think about: Know what needs to change.
