Despite an early rise everyone was in high spirits because they knew exactly what they were racing for, The Iris House Children’s Hospice.The day started off with some ice breakers, which helped all racers get to know each other before and help strategise within their teams. Teams raced against each other and points were added or subtracted on certain tasks that had to be completed along the way. There was also the chance to earn some bonus points! The race challenge saw the teams walking almost 10 kilometers in total, whilst getting to know the picturesque town of Stellenbosch inside out. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1811/469990-625x470.jpg" alt="Exponential, Amnet, iProspect, and PHD raise R5,000 for The Iris House Children's Hospice in the 2018 Amazing Race" width="625" height="470">The final task of the day really separated the winners from the losers.
