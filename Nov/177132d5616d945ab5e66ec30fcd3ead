ADCAN is a UK/USA-based competition run annually for unsigned filmmakers around the world to create a 30-60 second film for partnered charities of the competition. Short-listed filmmakers get the chance to go to LA for mentoring and a series of workshops with some of the best talent the industry have to offer including Mark Romanek and KK Barrett, as well as the awards ceremony with various categories. The films from the competition are then used worldwide for the charities. For example, one of the winning films at ADCAN for the charity 'Springster' will be used at taxi ranks in South Africa."Just being involved is such a great and worthwhile experience working on a project for a good cause. For us to have won the Grand Prix this year is very special, the prize is a commissioned piece of work for AirBnb and their Open Homes project, which offers homes to those affected by disasters, conflict, illness. This will happen 2019, so another project for good," says Peter.The Young Health Movement charity is all about disseminating information to young people about maintaining health and well-being, and this film tackles the need for youth to develop a positive relationship with social media. On top of the ADCAN exposure, the film has also been reviewed on David Reviews, a well-respected Advertising Industry page in the UK.
