It is humbling to be a part of such an incredible team of talented and impact-driven individuals QUESTIONS:You describe yourself as a 'creative activist'. What makes you unique from other activists and where do you draw your inspiration for your designs?  I draw my inspiration from the vibrance and energy of our beautiful continent. I'm inspired by my own journey as an African woman and how it is connected to a collective spirit of resilience and drive.  I believe that it is every creative's duty to cultivate positive narratives and I believe that creativity is a catalyst for positive social change.Why is it important for you to be part of the Global Citizen Festival : Mandela 100 and what does it mean for the future of Arts & Culture in Africa? The significance of being a part of the GC team for me is learning from a powerful model; pairing the power of music / creativity with a message that encourages active citizenry. I believe that if more collaborative efforts to mobilise people are initiated, we can work towards eradicating extreme poverty and other social ills.  What will it take for our African mindset to change in order to reach the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030? I believe that it begins with education and exposure to possibilities and opportunities. We (as creatives) should cultivate messages that transform the frame of reference for young Africans, so that they can believe in their individual potential and capability. It lies in the stories we tell (visual & written), the ground-level interventions that are sustainable and meaningful. What do you pledge to show your commitment to reach Global Citizen's goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030? To date, Global Citizens have taken over 3.71 million actions - that's approximately 33,423 actions per day, 1,392 actions per hour, 23 per minute! I pledge to channel my abilities into empowering women and girl children.  ABOUT GLOBAL CITIZENSince the first Global Citizen Festival in New York in 2012, Global Citizen has grown into one of the largest, most visible platforms for young people around the world calling on world leaders to honour their responsibilities in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and ending extreme poverty by 2030. Global Citizens have generated commitments and policy announcements from leaders valued at over $37.9bn that are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people. The organisation has taken its action-based model to Australia, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and Canada, and created a platform for activists to learn about the issues they care most about, take action, and earn rewards for doing so.High Level Figures of Direct Actions: 901 - HIV tests completed through our direct actions31% increase in New Blood Donations with a 20.53% increase in non-white donors.8627-  Bags of Trash Collected and 1 dumping site has now been turned into a park.192 - cleanups across 8 countries31% increase in New Blood Donations with a 20.53% increase in non-white donors.2050- students have taken part of education programs focused on girls/women health.Over 5000 Volunteers/Global Citizens have participated in these offline actions  75 people have received practical experience volunteering at Global Citizens and partner activations as part of a skills sharing program.Since the festival launch, close to a quarter million fans and activists in South Africa and Southern Africa have signed up to become Global Citizens.
