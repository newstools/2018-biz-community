Andrew Fradd, Group Managing Director of Mortimer Harvey, says the campaign was born from the need for Absa CIB to reestablish itself in the market and to further entrench Absa’s new positioning of ‘Africanacity’ – the distinctly African ability to always find ways to get things done. “The challenge put forward from client was to do so in a unique way that would break the category and differentiate Absa CIB from its competitors.” According to Andrew Ambrogioni, Mortimer Harvey’s Chief Creative Officer, the ‘I want to make that’ campaign is a concept that fires up the imagination, gives birth to innovation and sparks creativity – because it’s a truth that is at the very essence of who and what we are as Africans. “We are innovators, entrepreneurs, visionaries, revolutionaries, humans. It speaks to the ingenuity that epitomises our continent, and to the tenacity of our spirit; we know no limits, we challenge the expected and we always find a way to get things done. “And it is children who are most connected to this truth, uncluttered by sometimes negative experiences that confuse us in later life, that induce fears that stifle our spirit and create imaginary limitations. Children are not burdened by these fears.”  Ambrogioni elaborates: “This is a story about the purity of the human spirit – of the African spirit – and our unbridled potential for creative, inspiring, innovative thought and action. Above all, it is a uniquely African story, the tale of the human spirit facing uniquely African challenges and opportunities – and overcoming them. A story in which we, and the world around us, will change the future through an all-encompassing spirit – Africanacity.” The campaign is led by a 60-second TV advert that showcases a little girl with big dreams and the way she sees the world. It culminates in an older version of herself, still having the bravery to imagine, and the will to make her visions a reality – truly defining the meaning of Africanacity for CIB. Ambrogioni says the media placements for C-suite audiences needed careful consideration and planning in order to create an extremely targeted campaign: “To spread the positioning message to C-suite audiences, the campaign consisted of out-of-home elements – Gautrain stations and digital billboards in key business centres, airport and airport lounge branding, print and press ads in business publications, digital touchpoints across relevant sites and platforms, and cinemagraphs and posts on LinkedIn and Twitter. All of which pushed audiences to a campaign page where they would get the full positioning story and find out more about CIB.”  Clement Motale, Head - Marketing and Corporate Relations, Corporate and Investment Banking, comments: “For us, it’s exactly how we would like this part of the bank to be seen, to be experienced by our clients and colleagues, in that we don’t see boundaries, we see the possibilities in every opportunity.” Ambrogioni is confident that the campaign, now in its infancy and already yielding strong results, will continue to elevate Absa CIB and the brand and make it the bank of choice for local and global clients looking to invest in building our diverse continent.
