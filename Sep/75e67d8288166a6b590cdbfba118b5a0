The former is powered by machine learning and the latter is only capable of interacting by following pre-programmed rules.The fact is that chatbots are still in their infancy, and what we’re experiencing is just the tip of a billion-dollar industry in the space of 10 years. But the adoption of chatbots is catching on and large companies such as Uber, Sephora and CNN have fully adopted this technology.Chatbots are always available, they’re never rude, tired or irritated – they’re pleasant 24/7/365. This is why chatbots are prevalent in customer service related industries. A key driver for this has been the adoption of smartphone technology with IM (Instant Messenger) being the primary means of communication. IM is being adopted at a faster rate than social networks, with over 4.1 billion users worldwide using Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat and Slack as examples. Consumers are so used to instant communication in their private lives that they expect the same when they communicate with companies.Service-related and transactional conversationsAccording to Research and Markets, the chatbot market is expected to reach revenue of $3.1bn by 2021. Although South African consumers predominantly purchase goods in store, 76% of people are using their mobile devices to get more information from online sources, to help make their buying decisions.The aim of a successful chatbot is to create an experience where users feel like they’re speaking to a human being instead of to a sophisticated bot that is continually learning and optimising itself based on other user interactions.The possibilities are immense in retail, financial services, travel, hospitality and even in utilities for service-related and transactional conversations:Government: Chatbot technology has the potential to be a valuable tool in helping to transform the way people engage with government departments. Chatbots are able to communicate in any language, and they learn through engagement.Financial services: Users would be able to converse with the bot just as they would with a human being, providing advice or assisting with new accounts in any of our 11 official languages. Chatbots are also able to better understand the customer’s needs and requirements in a friendly and always-on manner.Hospitality: Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of enterprise-customer relationships will be managed without human interactions. It will be possible to interact with restaurants through IM with an emoji. Chatbots will be more than capable of taking reservations, placing orders and even recommending wine pairings if requested to do so. The bot will be able to remember this interaction for future interactions.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/458528.png" alt="Pic from QSR Magazine." width="625" height="1096" rel="">Pic from QSR Magazine.click to enlargeChatbots are already being used in the hotel industry, in their operational processes, and are reporting a good ROI.Healthcare and education: At the International Aids conference in Durban, MomConnect was launched by the Praekelt Foundation which has the potential to revolutionise healthcare in South Africa.

We won’t have to interact with buttons, text and images which can be cumbersome when interacting with different sites. In five to ten years, bots will be able to understand you completely – in whatever language you choose to use. In the future – talking to a bot will be like talking to a real person who has instant access to entire databases of information, and can process your thoughts and desires instantly!So, in short, every business needs to get a bot in order to communicate with people on message apps, and bots need to provide as much value as a website or mobile app.Here’s a brief history of chatbots (Chatbots Magazine):<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/458453.jpg" alt="Don't talk to me, talk to my chatbot" width="625" height="962">There is a spectrum of chatbots (Chatbots Magazine):<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/458455.jpg" alt="Don't talk to me, talk to my chatbot" width="625" height="977"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/458457.jpg" alt="Don't talk to me, talk to my chatbot" width="625" height="710">The most important takeout is that we need to embrace this AI technology and make it work for our brands within our consumer interactions because it’s coming, whether we like it or not!
