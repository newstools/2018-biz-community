We need to see more womxn featured in the media. The only way to change this is to stand together and change it ourselves..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are your best current food trends?I love that current trends are about the politics of food, we’re also using food to effect change. In another major shift, we will see a whole new category of food and drink entirely designed for womxn. We are not talking about ladies steak cuts on menus, we will see more meals designed specifically to aid womxn’s health, for example, menstruation boosters, fertility superfoods, etc. While the food industry is still a male-dominated arena at large, the foundations are shaking with the rise of female empowerment as seen across industries in 2018.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Worst trend? I ignore annoying trends, they tend to pass quickly.
