Pipul TV is founded on a principle of delivering content with no subscriber-side data costs through agreements with local telcos which are made feasible by the lower bitrates PERSEUS Plus enables.” Guido Meardi, CEO and co-founder at V-Nova, declared, “We’re proud to be supporting the ambitious Pipul TV service in one of the world’s most dynamic and rapid growth markets. Examples across the globe are showing today that IP delivery is what will drive massive growth in video and entertainment services, challenging existing networks and current technology solutions. This deployment is yet another great showcase for how our PERSEUS Plus technology can provide both substantially better viewing experiences and data delivery cost savings, whilst doing so at massive scale.” The Pipul TV OTT service will provide over 200 local and international live channels and a large catalogue of VOD content. The service is expected to reach 2 million subscribers within three years. The service will first be introduced on a dedicated streaming set-top-box and then to more connected devices over time. Source: http://nextvafrica.com/
