Based on this, products featured in Fresh Living, whether on ad pages or in editorial, enjoy the halo effect of that trust,” says editor Justine Drake.Research into Fresh Living readers, conducted by independent firm 5one, showed that there’s been an increased sales uplift for advertisers across October, November and December 2017. The stats support Drake’s claim: Skip Detergent up 167% Cadbury’s Chocolate up 66% Ceres Juice up 42% Bakers Provita Rice Cakes up 181% Canderel Sugarly up 171%It all just goes to prove that real engagement is simply about inspiring, relevant content... Always has been, always will.  “Fresh Living magazine continues to go from strength to strength – this can be seen by the fact that every month, 500 000 Smart Shoppers rush into Pick n Pay to grab a copy of the magazine. I believe that this is down to the quality and relevancy of the content and the easy, accessible recipes. Fresh Living is a brilliant representation of the Pick n Pay brand and continues to be one of our most fundamentally important marketing tools. The John Brown team understands the South African consumer, and this is what makes their work so powerful.” – Michelle van Schalkwyk-Haley, Head of Brand, Pick n PayLook out for the October 2018 issue’s fresh, new cover look, in-store on 19 September.Sources:* Brandmapp Survey 2018** Smart Shopper survey June 2018 & Shopper Centre Performance, 52 weeks ending 3 June 20185one analysis: Fresh Living October-December17 issuesAbout John Brown MediaJohn Brown South Africa is part of a leading global content agency, with clients such as Pick n Pay, Old Mutual, Life Healthcare, Discovery, Spur, BMW, MINI and Total locally, and Waitrose, John Lewis, Orange, RBS and Hannaford Supermarkets abroad.
