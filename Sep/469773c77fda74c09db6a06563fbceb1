It begs the question: Just how female-friendly is our industry if women aren’t taking on senior roles?Creating a women-friendly environmentWhilst I truly do believe that there is a genuine intention to create a female-friendly industry and provide the opportunity for women to take on senior roles, I also believe that their unequal treatment is possibly so systemic and ingrained we are seldom even aware of it. Take for example the fact that some people immediately assume that if a woman has a child she’s less likely to be career-driven or that she won’t want to travel for work or attend after-hours client functions. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/454886-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Don't blame women for leaving fields like engineering.

We see a fairly even split of male vs. female staff amongst junior staff and even in mid-level, however, it appears that more and more women are choosing to leave the industry at the senior level. If it isn’t due to a perceived undercurrent of inequality, why then are so many senior women opting out of our industry?This is not a conundrum unique to our industry - the tech industry in the U.S. was last year revealed to be particularly unfriendly to women – so how do we go about correcting the imbalances and creating a women-friendly environment? <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1803/434372-120x120.jpg?2" alt="WillyamBradberry © ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Attention!

Perhaps this involves female forums in every workplace to address the needs of women in particular and then entrench these into workplace policy and processes. How high is that glass ceiling?An open-door policy whereby any employee can influence company processes will increase employee involvement and contribute towards the friendliness of the workplace, regardless of gender. Let’s also give thought to what type of role models abound for women in our workplace – just how high is that glass ceiling in your agency? Are there senior mentors and role models to encourage and inspire female talent or is it largely a boys club?<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/454783-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Group photo of Elevator Agency's new female management team." width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: How Elevator's female leaders have shattered the glass ceilingWe often hear of the 'glass ceiling' that exists for women in business.
