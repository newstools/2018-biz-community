The 27-year-old rugby sensation is known for rising to the challenge and rallying those around him to answer the Nation's call. Kolisi is a perfect fit for Openview's vision - ensuring that entertainment is free for all, despite insurmountable odds. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459987.jpg" alt="The people's captain joins the people's champion" width="250" height="354">“I am really excited to join the Openview team on their quest to give South Africans free satellite television,” says Kolisi. “The idea that you can enjoy all kinds of entertainment - movies, news, sport and kids programmes with no monthly fees is groundbreaking. Being able to access knowledge and information is important and Openview is making that possible for millions of South Africans.” Raised in the small Zwide township on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, Kolisi quickly rose to prominence within the schoolboy rugby ranks. He was offered a bursary to Grey Junior Primary School and worked his way up to the first XV of Grey High School. In 2011 he was lured to Western Province and made his professional debut that same year. He earned his first Springbok cap in 2013 and has since represented South Africa in 35 tests where he was trusted with the captain's armband for the 2018 season - including the emphatic away victory over our arch rivals, the All Blacks, for the first time since 2009 - and has claimed a series victory over England in South Africa. With Siya Kolisi, Openview aims to encourage and motivate its viewers to believe in more than the usual that is on offer. As South Africa’s first free satellite TV service, Openview offers endless, exciting local and international entertainment in full high definition for a once-off payment of only R399, with no contracts, and no monthly fees.
