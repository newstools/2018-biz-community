Where do you live, work and play?Joburg, Cape Town and London.2. Describe your career so far. It's been one of learning and inspiration and enjoying the roles I have had. I’ve also been inspired by mentors that I seem to gravitate towards at each business where I have worked. I love to work in environments that involve passionate people.

Travelling, Snow-skiing, golf, my kids – two girls.4. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Typically, it starts at 6am, where I spend the first three hours of the day on the most important tasks ahead, touching base with my teams and setting us up for the day ahead. From there, it’s typically meetings and engaging with clients where possible. 4pm is typically the time I switch to ‘dad mode’ and spend time with my kids during daylight hours, doing things like reading, riding bikes and just hanging out with them. Once they're asleep, it’s a last clear out of emails and then settling down into a Netflix series.5. What are the tools of your trade?

List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Too many agencies are still hung up about where you’re located and sitting in their office to get work done. This is so unproductive. I am all for teams that work together and being accountable for what they do, not where they are. I’m also tired of businesses constantly saying that agencies need to be more creative or push the boundaries when they’re not willing to allocate sufficient budgets to this cause. It usually ends up with watered-down executions instead of something truly exciting. 8. What are you working on right now?
