The annual BASA Awards recognise and honour businesses that invest in an inclusive economy through art. Guests included the cream of the corporate and entrepreneurial world; artists representing every genre of creativity; and government representatives.  “We warmly congratulate each winner and thank all the finalists for their commitment to supporting and working with creative people,” said BASA Chairman Andre le Roux.  Heidi Brauer, Chief Marketing and Customer Officer at Hollard, says: “In beautiful harmony with Hollard’s special partnership model, the BASA Awards really do deliver win-win-win.  “Artists benefit through having their work recognised and celebrated; corporates grow their brand and gain exposure to the creative arts; and broader society is enriched through the conversation, challenge and stimulation provided by art that may not otherwise have seen the light of day. Such partnerships enable a better future for us all.”   The BASA Awards recognise partnerships that lead the way in growing the macro-economy by building bridges between the corporate sector and the arts.

It’s our duty, and our privilege, to work with this generation for the benefit of the next,” said Chairman Le Roux.  Winner trophies reflect the Legacy theme of the 2018 BASA Awards. Each trophy comprises a circular base atop of which is positioned four individually crafted, handmade rings making each trophy unique. The rings depict a diversity of arts, people and enterprises. They symbolise the variety, diversity and texture that comes from a strong legacy foundation. Artists from across South Africa collaborated on crafting the rings. Among them were the artists at Smelt Studios and artist Ben Tuge (resident at Victoria Yards).  The Legacy theme was also highlighted by BASA Chief Executive, Michelle Constant, who is stepping down from her position after 10 years. She spoke of the growth and opportunities developed by BASA, and highlighted by the wonderful business arts partnerships that have developed over the years.  The BASA Awards, Constant said, are accolades the organisation was proud and honoured to bestow. However, as important is the work of each winner and every finalist to contribute to South Africa’s creative economy: to make the arts and creativity drivers of economic growth and of entrepreneurial strategy.  BASA has distributed grants to the value of more than R34 million to nearly 1 490 art projects. Since 1997, South Africa’s corporate sector has leveraged more than R440m from BASA grants.
