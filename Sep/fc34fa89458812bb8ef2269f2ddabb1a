Peers nominate the winners and the judging panel selects them. Beaulah’s keen sense of design thinking, marketing, production and project management, coupled with her deep understanding and recognition of the diversity of cultures, brands and people has stood her clients in good stead, where delivering almost impossible tasks is done with great attention to detail. She started her working career at the SABC, after completing her studies in design and production. After a three-year tenure at the SABC, she moved on to enter the international arena in project development, design and event architecture. Her unique understanding of the South African consumer, together with her creative skills has earned her accolades from multinational companies and South African corporates alike. Beaulah has been part of the project management team producing the annual South African Film and Television Awards (SAFTAS) since 2013, with Litha Communications hosting the events in collaboration with Gallagher Convention Centre. She was responsible for the conceptualising of the event décor for each year’s theme, set-up and event flow, in line with the international standards of such award shows. In the production of the Ubuntu Honour awards for the National Heritage Council of South Africa, Beaulah has delivered meaningful events from Mapungubwe to Dar es Salaam, in keeping with the event’s aim to foster social cohesion and enhance nation-building. Among her industry tributes, was a ‘true-to-scale exhibition’ of Robben Island, depicting the environmental, recent history and tourism facets of the island at the Rand Easter Show. The exhibition won a Silver Award, adjudicated according to International Exhibition Standards. As the project director for Litha’s client, SA Breweries, she conceptualised and managed brand activations for a stokvels database of more than 10,000 members (70% female) across the country. Combining her own international travel, lifestyle trend-spotting, understanding and passion for South Africa, Africa and the world, she has been instrumental in the establishment of Litha as a company with impeccable credentials and an unrivalled record of accomplishment and experience. Her knowledge and intrinsic understanding of international brands has seen her take Litha to international heights in the events and conferencing space. “I am honoured to have been nominated and to have been part of such an awards programme and I salute my fellow winners, who truly understand the complex nature of the MICE industry,” concludes Beaulah.
