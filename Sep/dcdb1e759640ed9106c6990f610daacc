How do you feel about it, and the new time slot?I have been in radio for 17 years and have had the honour of being part of an afternoon drive team for at least 11.5 years on two commercial radio stations. To be offered my very own show is one of my radio dreams come true! I feel so excited to be in a new time slot and to grow more in my career.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1709/412257-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Wessels and Vergotine." width="120" height="120">The serious side of Smile 90.4FM with The Honest TruthTrue to the fact that volatile and challenging topics can't be avoided, Smile 90.4FM's new late-night talk show called The Honest Truth, serves as a counter balance to the station's generally positive workday programming...By Leigh Andrews 28 Sep 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about Smile 90.4FM and where it’s going?Smile 90.4 FM is still a relatively new radio station and it’s incredible to be part of its growth. I love the family we have here – not only in the office, but with our audience too. In a time when we are so drained from negative news, it’s refreshing to be a part of a station that 'amplifies the good news in the Mother City'..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in radio?I love that no two days are the same.I still feel this buzz of excitement in my whole body, as I switch on the microphone. I love being able to entertain, connecting with people daily, really listening to their stories (everyone has one) and being able to share information. I hope that when someone listens to me, they either learn something, feel something and take something away that makes their day a little brighter..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What did it take to get to where you are today?Resilience, hard work, never quitting, believing in myself and being motivated by those naysayers who tried to cut me down, rather than build me up. I am extremely passionate about what I do and I love that I do what I love.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459272-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Newsmaker: Kia Johnson joins Smile 90.4FM" width="120" height="120">#Newsmaker: Kia Johnson joins Smile 90.4FMKia Johnson recently joined Smile 90.4FM, co-hosting the Saturday Smile Breakfast with JM Henning from 7am to 10am, and as the host of Smile Cape Town Classics from 9pm to 11pm on Saturdays.

There is so much that goes into a show and it takes a lot of time researching, writing, coming up with ideas and fresh content and ensuring that you deliver it in a concise, entertaining way.I don’t think people know what goes on behind the scenes… For example, what people didn’t see was me expressing breast milk and making sure I got it to my husband in time to feed our baby, while getting back on stage to MC or making it in time for my radio show.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
