The 2018 Summit was a seminal milestone for BRICS cooperation, marking as it did a decade of BRICS cooperation at the highest diplomatic level. According to account director Leandra Moodley, the theme for the 10th BRICS Summit was "BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution" and reflected the priorities of the BRICS members, that is, to strive towards the creation of an inclusive society and global partnerships that will bring prosperity to all humankind. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/457011.jpg" alt="FCB Joburg assists host 10th Annual BRICS Leaders' Summit" width="444" height="333">“The agency was briefed to assist Brand South Africa and the dti with the BRICS Business Forum, one of several events making up the BRICS Leaders’ Summit,” she said. “Its responsibility was the creative curatorship and delivery of an event for 1,200 delegates that included a panel discussion session in the afternoon and a cocktail party in the evening. Attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa and Chinese President Xi Jinping, it was critical that the creative design and execution projected South Africa as a highly industrialised country embracing the Fourth Industrial Revolution.” The agency’s response was ‘slick and clean’, much like the identity seen at the World Economic Forum on Africa in 2018 earlier this year. “It was a challenging task, addressed within a very tight time frame,” she said. “However, it was highly successful, and we are thrilled to have been able to contribute so positively to South Africa’s role and image within the BRICS community.” Credits:Creative agency:                                   FCB Joburg               Account director:                                 Leandra Moodley     Executive creative director:                    Neo Segola                  Art director:                                           Engelbert PhiriPrint production & DTP:                        Monica Maloka, Rachel Madonsela, Nicole Fitzsimons, Cynthia Mahapeletja, Taheerah Moosa Events team:                                        Audrey Lummis, Thembeka Bhengu, Lydia Rangata, Nokuthula Langa
