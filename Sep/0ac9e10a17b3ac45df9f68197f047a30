Partnering with TLC Marketing on this campaign spoke heavily to what we as brand stand for, which is recognition and rewards. We managed to give the consumer an experience outside of what one would expect from Tupperware. Tupperware is more than a household essential it allows people to come together and so is the case with soccer."The first 200,000 customers who purchase the soccer branded Lunch Sets will receive a soccer ticket to watch any PSL soccer match of their choice. The campaign runs from 5 September to 2 October 2018.
