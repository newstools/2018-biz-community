Perfect. Every time – and reinforce Tastic’s leadership position within the rice market,” said marketing director, Thembi Sehloho.“The team had also identified that there were unmet consumer needs that presented a gap in the market, now satisfied by the two new rice variants recently launched by Tastic (Tastic Soft & Absorbing White Rice and Tastic Wholegrain Long Grain Brown Rice). Tastic understood that consumers needed variants that were both different from parboiled rice as well as accessible from a price point perspective, giving the consumer greater choice for even greater meals.“The agency was tasked with launching these new and exciting variants to the Tastic target market in a way that would assist the brand in quickly creating product awareness. The campaign will build on the existing love consumers have for the brand and communicate the brand’s innovation while highlighting the different benefits and uses for these rice types.” The campaign developed in response to the brief highlights the strong emotional connection all consumers have with Tastic, regardless of their age or cooking styles. It also reinforces Tastic’s well-known functional benefits and superior quality rice. The campaign line "Only One Tastic" solidifies the idea that everyone has a different way of cooking but the one thing everyone agrees on is Tastic Rice - There is only One Tastic that cooks perfectly, every time.“The core insight guiding our approach for these commercials was that, even though we are a multicultural society, there are chords that bind us,” said creative director, Greg Cameron, who worked with copywriter Verona Singh and art director Kursten Meyer to develop the campaign.“We come from different walks of life and we live that life in different ways. We have different approaches to how we exercise and keep healthy, how we manage our finances, inspire our children, we choose different meals to eat together as a family. “But, even if we do choose to make the same meal for dinner and put our own spin on it, there will always be something – one thing – that we have in common. For rice lovers, it’s Tastic.”The ads were shot by Seriti over four days in various locations around Soweto, Linden, Parkwood, Saxonwold and Kensington. They are flighting on SABC 1, 2 and 3, as well as e.tv and DStv.Credits:Client: Tiger BrandsBrand: TasticMarketing director: Thembi Sehloho Creative agency: FCB JoburgAccount director: Bronwyn SimonsChief creative officer: Ahmed TillyCreative director: Greg CameronCopywriter: Verona Singh                            Art director: Kursten Meyer               Strategic planner: Sihle DlaminiTV production: Ayanda Tshabalala        Media planners: Isla Prentis and Ronel Pote’ (The Media Shop)    Production companies: Seriti Director: Thabang MoleyaEditor: Nick GishenPost production: Fuel Content
