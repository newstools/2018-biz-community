How do you feel about it, and the time slot in particular? I’m so excited and already having so much fun with both weekend shows. Smile Saturday Breakfast, which airs from 7am to 10am, is fast-paced, engaging and interactive, and Smile Cape Town Classics, which airs from 9pm to 11pm on Saturday evenings, brings back that nostalgic Cape Town feeling with a range of music that showcases the true historic moments of the Mother City.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about Smile 90.4FM and where it’s going?

I love that radio is always evolving and has an ability to create a visual portrayal of what you are bringing to your audience. Radio also has a very personal way that it communicates with you and a medium you can take everywhere. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What did it take to get to where you are today? It took hard work, determination and perseverance. Consistency is also key and being prepared to be flexible in an ever-changing work environment are the kinds of qualities that have sustained me. I'm always willing to lend a hand where I can and prepared to put in the hard work where I need to..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list in your new position? The two shows are unique, I'm eager to take you on a trip down memory lane every Saturday evening with Smile Cape Town Classics. I want listeners to remember the music that gave them joy and love and great memories. With Smile Saturday Breakfast I'm looking forward to a more fun-filled show and maintaining our fantastic engagement with our audience..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You also present All Women TV on DSTV Channel 263. How do you balance your various roles, both career-wise and personal? I try my utmost to maintain a routine, even though both environments are quite busy, the routine has helped me. I believe in taking a breather to rejuvenate, which means exercise is a must, spending time with good friends and family and making sure to go on regular road trips. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Following on from Women’s Month, what did it take to get to where you are today? I've had to have a lot of patience and be prepared to give not only 100% but 150% to whichever work role has come my way. I'm a mom as well, to two very busy toddlers so that adds to my workload. Being a woman, I've been blessed to be a multi-tasker of note. This has been a great strength for me. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any specific challenges you’ve faced that you think were unique to you being female? As a woman I've been judged in a variety of ways, there isn't one woman I know that hasn't. I've experienced discrimination, low pay in comparison to my male counterparts and not given opportunities because as a woman, 'you're not strong enough to get certain roles'. Thankfully the industry has begun a point of change and even though the discrimination remains, there's been an awakening and a realisation of the importance of women's rights..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading, watching or listening to for work? With many news stories reflecting negative information, I've begun researching positive and feel-good stories that encompass those who are doing amazing work, people with great tenacity for upliftment and those who are trying their utmost to make our communities a better place. Smile90.4FM is an inspiring station and has changed my outlook on how I research and receive news. It's a breath of fresh air, which I will continue to verbalise. Tell us something about yourself not generally known. I can still do the bridge and the handstand. I can imitate the voices of the animated characters, Woody Woodpecker and Goofy. I'm also known for making deliciously yummy vegan dishes.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
