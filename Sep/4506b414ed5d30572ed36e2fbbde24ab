CX solutions will evolve to provide scalable and flexible digital as well as mobile customer self-service and commerce solutions across existing and new engagement channels to meet the needs of customers who prefer to solve their own problems. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), behavioural analytics, and other innovations are helping progressive companies capitalise on internal and third-party data to deliver highly personalised communications, promotional offers, and service engagements. For example, AI will allow businesses to reward and recognise loyal consumers by ‘learning’ their digital footprints. This will allow customers to get special attention and a meticulous service without them even having to sign-up for such services. Companies should evaluate cloud services according to how complete, integrated, and extendable the CX platform is for supporting the entire customer journey. As new disruptive technologies come to the market, whether that’s the mainstreaming of IoT or drones for business; companies will be under constant pressure to integrate these new capabilities to improve their CX strategies. With the right cloud solution, companies can continually evolve to meet tomorrow’s CX challenges.
