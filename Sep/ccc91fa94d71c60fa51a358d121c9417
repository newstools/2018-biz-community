In addition to writing on the cars, the race number will have space for the nearly 12,000 participants to show who they are walking for on Saturday, 27 October.Part of the fun element will be pink doeks that will be given to the women who attended the Media Launch on Tuesday, 11 September, to help raise awareness in Port Elizabeth. "Everyone is affected by cancer. With one in nine South African women and one in six men at risk of developing cancer during their lifetime it is no wonder that the Algoa FM Big Walk for Cancer powered by the Eastern Cape Department of Health is the biggest single mass participation event in the Eastern Cape," says Dave Tiltmann, Algoa FM Managing Director. This year's walk will be led by brand ambassadors writer, columnist, author, speaker and businesswoman Kazeka (Cancer Lioness) Kuse and former broadcaster and founder of sports marketing company Believ Content Agency Xylon van Eyck.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/457867.jpg" alt="Messages of hope for those affected by cancer" width="600" height="400">"Both are incredibly inspiring individuals who have beaten cancer," says Tiltmann.Funds raised by the 2018 Big Walk will go towards the purchase of a FotoFinder Mole analyser for the local branch of the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA).
