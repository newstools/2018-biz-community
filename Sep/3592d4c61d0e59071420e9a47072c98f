Expectations continue to increaseIn the age of social media, customers not only expect a meaningful two-way conversation but also insist that brands act on what they have to say.At the same time, customers have become more demanding while their expectations continue to increase. In fact, almost two-thirds of the respondents’ expectations have risen compared to a year ago.It all comes down to better customer service. Almost all respondents cited the quality of customer service as a determinant of their choice and loyalty to a brand, while 61% walked away from a brand due to poor customer service.How to increase customer serviceSo how do companies increase their customer service?By being proactive in finding ways to get closer to their customersBy opening up communication channels and encouraging two-way communicationBy listening to and acting upon their customers’ feedback (90% of respondents value the opportunity to provide feedback)Through personalised value-add experiencesBy turning negative experiences (such as customer complaints) into positive outcomesBy being present on multiple channels (almost 60% of respondents used three or more channels to find answers to their questions).Ultimately, customer service remains one of the most important competitive differentiators.
