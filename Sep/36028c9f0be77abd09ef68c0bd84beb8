At this year’s gathering, Phambili Africa welcomed a heavyweight delegation from Grey agencies across the region including: Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Phambili is derived from isiZulu, which means to go forward. It is time for Africa to reimagine a future filled with arts, technology, science and business innovations that are steeped in cultural aesthetic. The objective for the Phambili Africa conference has been to future-focus the Grey network and ensure that it is set up for these future opportunities. Over the three days, we shared insights, best-practice thinking and growth opportunities centred around the theme of creativity to solve business problems.  A number of external speakers also shared their views on Africa’s future opportunities including guests from Uber, NBA, GroupM, Kantar, AbInbev, DFX and Mereto.  “Grey Worldwide operates with the mindset of a 100-year-old start-up – hungry, ambitious, entrepreneurial and open to driving continual transformation.
