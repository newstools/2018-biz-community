In accordance with the companyâ€™s commitment to reinvest in the 32 hectare Gallagher Convention Centre property and facilities, the entrance arch has undergone refurbishment and is now sporting an exciting and renewed appearance.The entrance that used to be clad in white marble is now tiled in black with the Gallagher logo fixed in gold lettering. 427 Square meters of black tiles were used for recladding the entire entrance. The project commenced in May 2018, and we are very excited to share the finalised project with you.Book a site visit with one of our friendly sales consultants to come and experience the upgrade first-hand.
