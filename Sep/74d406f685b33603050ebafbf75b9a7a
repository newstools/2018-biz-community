Tell us a few of your favourite things. My wife, movies and TV, cooking, three stripes and YNWA. 5. What do you love about your industry? There’s so much to learn out there as young filmmakers. Although our feature film industry is starting to thrive, it’s still a rather niche market, with only the odd Oscar-winning art house film succeeding here and there. Advertising, however, has a huge amount to offer. Talented creatives and storytellers, visual craftsmen, highly skilled and hardworking crew and the necessary toys and ‘funds’ to make it all happen. Most of all, South African marketers are starting to explore and celebrate our uniqueness, so as a filmmaker, it’s an exciting place to be. 6. What are a few pain points your industry can improve on? In years gone by, our industry had quite a bold creative voice whereas today, it’s a lot safer to rely on social media statistics and focus groups to guide that voice. Ultimately, this is leading to the softening of our raw creativity and keeping everything boxed in.7. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Coffee. Open laptop. Internet. That’s an average workday. For above average workdays...  8. What are the tools of your trade? With the internet, Keynote, Photoshop, pen and paper and a set of headphones, I’d bet you could pretty much do anything.  9. Who is getting it right in your industry?

What are you working on right now? I would say, but it’s highly confidential! 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. I’m all about a buzzword. At the moment I’m all about the “feels.” I’d say “insular” and “diversity/diversification” are two others I hear quite regularly. 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? For me, they seem to appear in the moments I least expect them.     “@robin_ladams is not the type to sing his own praises but his reel speaks for itself,” says @colyhow . “His visual eye stands out across all his work.” < @bizcommunity A post shared by  Egg Films (@eggfilms) on Jul 19, 2018 at 3:47am PDT  13.
