The inaugural competition enthused sports and motoring fans countrywide in 2016 , and is set to do so again in 2018.Commenting on the win, Senior Advertising Manager at Toyota SA, Tasneem Lorgat, said it reinforced the Toyota SA/FCB Joburg team’s belief in the concept. “As South Africans, we are incredibly passionate about two things; sport and vehicles. Toyota has a long-running association with local sports and we felt – in 2016 when we were planning the first competition – that this campaign could effectively leverage the two passions of our nation.“The Fortuner 4x4 Challenge provides the perfect opportunity to engage with our customers, whilst showcasing the skill and versatility of both our local ‘heroes’ and the super-capable Toyota Fortuner. The fact that we do so with exciting and effective marketing just improves our reach and interaction. We are incredibly proud,” she said.The agency’s campaign for the 2018 edition is an apocalypse-themed ‘super power’ showdown featuring Mapule Ndlovu, a fitness athlete; Steffi Brink, a track hero; Ox Nche, a Cheetahs rugby player; and Giniel de Villiers, Toyota’s own racing hero.The campaign runs from August to October.
