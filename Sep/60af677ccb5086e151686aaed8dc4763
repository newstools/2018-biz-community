This partnership will enable telecom operators to deliver IPTV services to market faster and capitalise on opportunities to maximise revenues as they acquire subscribers.  We expect this solution to become an engine of growth for OSN, Huawei and the wider broadcast industry in this region as connectivity improves across the region.”On the other hand, the VP of Huawei Middle East, Sun Xiaofeng, expressed, “We are pleased to collaborate with OSN and we look forward to working together to bring the best content and viewing experiences to audiences in this region.“The cloud offering to telecom operators will extremely minimise their risks and barriers of launching their own IPTV services as well as shorten the time to market by 80%. We hope this MoU will strengthen the digital video ecosystem in the region and we look forward to continuing to grow this industry in the Middle East.”This collaboration comes at a time when the video market in the Middle East is booming, with telecom operators occupying an increasingly important role in content delivery. Delivering the growing demand for exclusive and high-quality content via IPTV is therefore a pre-requisite for operators in the region as they intent to cater customer demand, enhance loyalty through triple-play offers (telephone, broadband and TV services), and drive progressive revenue.Source: http://nextvafrica.com/ .
