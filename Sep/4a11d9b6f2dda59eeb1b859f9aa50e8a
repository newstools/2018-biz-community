Both have also been appointed to FCB Joburg’s Exco along with integrated executive business director on the South African Tourism Business Unit, Annicia Manyaapelo. The trio’s appointment brings the number of women on FCB Joburg’s 11-strong Exco to six, or 56%.  Making the announcement, FCB Joburg managing director, Thabang Skwambane, praised the trio’s talent and tenacity. "Neo’s contribution to FCB Joburg’s success and her ability to deliver campaigns that truly speak to today’s South African consumer was felt the moment she walked through the door," he said. “Most recently, her work alongside Khanyi Mpumlwana, Vusi Khoza and Nobantu Sibeko for South African Tourism on the ‘It’s Your Country, Enjoy It’ campaign was highly praised by the travel industry, ordinary South Africans and her peers,” said Skwambane.“Collette has had a major impact on that account as well, most noticeably as the creative director on ‘Bheki the Mbhaco Maker’, a vibrant and engaging short film that broke the mould for destination marketing. Collette also led the team who designed the rebranding of Africa’s Travel Indaba for South African Tourism, and both her and Neo were instrumental in putting South African Tourism’s best foot forward at Africa’s Travel Indaba in 2016, 2017 and most recently, in May 2018. “We’re all incredibly privileged to have these three accomplished, capable and strong women in our business, not only their creative vision and spirit, but their belief in themselves and their commitment to help transform our industry by nurturing talented and ambitious young minds – especially women – and equipping them with practical tools to be a success in the world.“A graduate of the AAA School of Advertising and with several years as at ZK Advertising in Nigeria on her CV before joining FCB Joburg in 2014, Neo has proven her mettle as a creative director at the agency on many accounts. “Collette, who cut her branding teeth at Enterprise IG (now Brand Union), was approached by FCB Joburg in 2011 to rebuild its design capability. Within two years, the agency was awarded at Cannes Lions, D&AD, Loeries, Clios and the New York Festivals. In 2015, she handed over the design portfolio to her 2IC to creatively partner with Neo on the South African Tourism business, a portfolio that has always been close to her heart.“Annicia believes in the power of creativity to affect change and that – by harnessing the varied and rich cultures of our people – we have the opportunity to reshape the African narrative. A graduate of GIBS Business School and both the AAA School of Advertising and Vega Brand Communications School, where she studied communications, media and brand management, Annicia joined the agency after several years as a successful luxury entrepreneur in the art and design sector. She has also served on the Iziko Museum Committee in Cape Town and as an Art Gala Host Member for Zeitz MOCAA (Museum of Contemporary African Art).“All three ladies are talented and professional contributors to the success of FCB Joburg, as well as that of their clients. I anticipate that they will contribute even more in their new positions and as members of FCB Joburg’s Exco. Thank you for being part of our journey, ladies,” he said.
