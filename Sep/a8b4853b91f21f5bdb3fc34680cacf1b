Months after the defeat of Negan under an alliance of communities spearheaded by Rick Grimes, the ninth season focuses on the united communities as they face obstacles and threats both outside and inside their alliance, with the threat of the mysterious Whisperers looming. When asked what fans can look forward to into the next season, executive producer Angela Kang shared, “We are starting with a time jump and we're playing with time this season, so that gives us the opportunity to see where our characters are at after the war has ended with the chapter that was preceding all-out war and we get to see the world in a way that we've never seen it on the show before. We're seeing that nature is taking over. We see that manmade structures are falling down and that provides challenges to our group, and we see how intrepid they are and how clever they are in dealing with these new challenges as well as all the interpersonal relationships they have with each other. We're dealing with themes about civilization and how do you build a civilization? How do you look to the past to build for the future?”And to celebrate this new season and get fans looking forward to 8 October, Fox will be setting up a Walking Dead activation at this year’s Comic Con Africa. The activation, complete with walk-in cage, online gaming, live Zombies and Walking Dead merchandise to be won is sure to be a hit with gamers and fans alike.As in post-apocalyptic Alexandria, the action won’t be contained to one place.
