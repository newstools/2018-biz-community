The team will initially be stationed at major intersections in Fourways, starting at  Fourways Crossing to the highway on William Nicol Drive and Cedar and Witkoppen and Witkoppen and Main Roads.Jean Berdou, Chair of Future City Fourways, says, “We are thrilled to have Hot 91.9FM as our partner in this initiative. This is the start of a long term relationship where we take back one intersection at a time in the Johannesburg area. Hot 91.9FM is a much-loved, well-known community driven station and our partnership with them will certainly ensure that listeners are guided through the traffic with up-to-date traffic reports and the Hot Squad there keeping a lookout.”Berdou adds: “This project is about so much more than just alleviating traffic and reporting crime incidents. It is also making a worthy contribution towards job creation for people from underprivileged communities.” Lloyd Madurai, Managing Director of Hot 91.9FM says, “We are extremely proud to have partnered with Future City Fourways on the Hot Squad Initiative. Our collective focus is to help keep you, the citizens, safe, 12 hours a day, five days a week. It’s part of Hot 91.9’s commitment to the community that we serve, continuing to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those around us.”  The Hot Squad will be at major intersections in Fourways from 06h00 to 18h00 weekdays.
