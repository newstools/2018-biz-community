They feel the pressure and worry about the pressure they are under.It’s pressure on yourself to be the best you can be, especially as the digital revolution is here. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1608/357176.jpg" alt="The dark side of digital" width="120" height="120">The dark side of digitalIt's their 'world in their hands', an existence driven by instant access to information, laced with a plethora of social connections...By Antoinette Pombo 24 Aug 2016This segued into the next topic of the morning: startup pressures, with Neethling addressing six key pressures facing the South African youth in 2018. Of these, Neethling said the first is family pressure, with over half of the study’s sample saying their parents do not understand the pressure they are under – the daily pressure and stresses of school.  This may sound familiar but Neethling confirms it’s a “different kind of hard,” as these are often the children of the struggle generation, with parents who say they won freedom for them, which the youth are now wasting. They’re also aware that it’s not long before they will be in a caregiving role themselves.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/456601-120x120.jpg?4" alt="Slide 161 of Youth Report (2018).

The easiest example of this is when their university life is drastically separate from their home life, meaning they need to transition constantly from one set of circumstances to another, in terms of both language and behaviour.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/456370-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cover image of Youth Report (2018).

You need to stand out and by doing what your peers are not – being extreme. There’s pressure to look good, to be well, to fit in. Respondents said they often pretend to be OK, particularly online, to save face and hide their vulnerabilities, so it’s linked to self-esteem.This rolls into the fourth form of pressure: remaining relevant.Fomo and phubbingThis is captured in Fomo or the Fear of Missing Out and the ubiquitous nature of ‘being on’, in case we miss something. As a result, there are high levels of engagement throughout the day on social media, no matter the time. It’s a case of constantly splitting their attention whether that’s while on their commute, watching TV, interacting with family or studying.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1309/146223-120x120.jpg" alt="e-touch vs. p-touch" width="120" height="120">e-touch vs. p-touchI have the privilege of having a teenage daughter whom I adore and have watched her communicate with people over the last five years in an increasingly, what I call, e-touch environment, where one-dimensional communication through technology has taken over from the p-touch environment that has created us as human beings.By Alan Russell 12 Sep 2013Neethling said this has definitely led to the rise of ‘content driving content’, and watching certain TV shows just because they start trending on Twitter, and well as ‘phubbing’ or phone snubbing – that’s when you’re on your phone while around family, friends or colleagues in real life. For the older generation, the person in front of you took precedence, while the younger set say the person they are ‘already talking to on the phone’ takes precedence.Think of the levels of hate speech out there. Think of that relief you often feel that social media wasn’t around when you were at school. And we don’t even know the half of it. The fifth form of pressure Neethling listed was lack of money. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/442489.jpg" alt="Personal finance tips for students to prepare for the real world" width="120" height="120">Personal finance tips for students to prepare for the real worldHaving been a student and in the working world, there are some things I wish that I had known about earlier that would have helped me with personal finance tips...By Laeeka Khan, Issued by Damelin 29 May 2018Many feel they were protected while at school, and only on starting their tertiary studies do they realise their family is struggling financially, that they’re not as well off as others. Some feel the past is holding them back, others simply can’t afford to go out with their peers or to buy data. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/455507-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source:" width="120" height="120">South Africa's university students face a crisis: nearly a third go hungryThere is a common perception that students represent the elite, and so cannot possibly suffer from hunger...By Stephen Devereux 30 Aug 2018The sixth form of pressure Neethling mentioned is that of securing a job.This is a massive problem, as Bhorat mentioned the economy is just not creating opportunities. According to Child Gauge 2017, the economy is not generating demand to expand employment. On average, South Africa lost more than 170,000 jobs per annum over the past nine years. At the same time, the youth segment grew by 200,000 per annum. You do the math.There’s also a rise of misaligned opportunities, and constant competition – there’s always someone better than you, racing for the same job. There are high expectations on what you can achieve, and there’s a prevailing sense of uncertainty, as having a degree doesn’t guarantee a job, and once you start working, there’s no such thing as job security.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/456480-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image © Prazis via ." width="120" height="120">#YouthReport2018: Generation jobless and the high inequality economyExplaining concepts like the 'missing middle' and various African economic myths and misconceptions, Professor Haroon Bhorat shared the harsh economic realities of growing up in South Africa today, at the launch of the UCT Unilever Institute of Strategic Marketing's Youth Report 2018...By Leigh Andrews 3 days agoNeethling concluded with Accenture’s 2017 finding from ‘Creating the workforce of the future’, that 35% of jobs are currently at risk of automation, as the default is always to do the job with fewer people. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/456696.jpg" alt="Slide 172 of Youth Report (2018).
