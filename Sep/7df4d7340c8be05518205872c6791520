But, if you are such a person, take care that the pitch team isn’t storeys removed from the content makers. Authenticity is one of the key elements that lets customers know they can trust you. In the B2B world customers aren’t just clicking a website icon to buy a Moleskin journal, a novel, the hand-crafted blade for a Roubo-style frame saw, or mobile bluetooth speaker. They can’t just rely on a couple of anonymous, starred user reviews to create a warm and fuzzy feeling that their job is secure, their career in safe hands, and their kids won’t go hungry on Christmas day. They’re coming to you looking for advice, expertise, help, assistance, guidance, consulting - because they usually have a complex business issue for which they need expert help to create or deploy a solution. You wouldn’t trust a bank manager who dressed like a hippie and your customers won’t keenly trust your thought leaders if they serve up stories that put the angle at the end (“…because you start at the beginning and work forwards from there”), carry twenty-word headlines, or are peppered with quotation marks where no “quotations” exist. It’s unprofessional and when your job is on the line you would also think twice. Just as you can’t trust a subject matter expert of, say, deep packet inspection to know how to craft a quality piece of marketing content, you cannot expect marketing and PR writers to know the ins and outs of deep packet inspection. Not without guidance, of course. IT beggars believe that there are still some people who think writers should understand the fine nuance of complex, technical topics without some form of tutelage. Deep packet inspection is not a terrifically difficult concept for the technically-minded. But which person could be expected to know all about that topic, as well as ultra high temperature dairy product treatment and aseptic packaging, in addition to the evolution of DevOps in an agile world meeting the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution head-on, and be able to write thousand-word thought leaderships, think pieces, op-eds, feature submissions, news stories, and case studies. You should, of course, expect that there is at least one writer in the world who can grasp all of these topics, and more, once an expert explains it to them. If the writer cannot grasp the topic then they cannot write with authority and that will quickly undermine any authenticity you seek. It will also make your expert, whose name is attached to the article, blog, white paper, ebook or other content, look like a a bit of a nitwit. It’s important then that, when you look for an agency to help you establish authority and authenticity in your industry, you check the capabilities of the people who will actually create the content for your business.
