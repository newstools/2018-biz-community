With that, this campaign will significantly create a bespoke shopper experience and open up all sorts of possibilities for brand engagement.” This campaign is currently running in selected shopping malls in Cape Town (V&A Waterfront and Canal Walk) and Johannesburg (Eastgate and Sandton City) throughout the month of September with a combined monthly foot count of 7,361,771 on average. As part of this partnership, Primedia Outdoor delivers holistic mall media solutions through hanging banners, escalators and interior billboards along the main walkways ensuring that shoppers have the opportunity to see messaging on the move. These high-end malls were found to be fitting for this launch considering their unique capabilities to create personalised shopper experiences through their high-impact advertising displays in coveted spaces. Taking into account the needs of customers which range from variety, convenience, safety, ambiance to ease of access – these four distinctive shopping malls have proven to meet all of those needs to attract shoppers and increase their stay time. Commenting on the suitability of malls for product launches within the luxury category, Peter Lindstrom, Sales & Marketing Executive of Primedia Outdoor, said, “Considering the competitive nature of luxury goods industry, mall media allows brands to connect with shoppers beyond the point-of-purchase and momentously deliver stand-out advertising solutions when they are evaluating their purchase decisions – this is of importance when introducing new products or services.” About Primedia Outdoor Primedia Outdoor is the premier provider of out-of-home media solutions within sub-Saharan Africa.
