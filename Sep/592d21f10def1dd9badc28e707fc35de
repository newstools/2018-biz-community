The phenomena presents to us a huge opportunity to expedite our vision of a digital first business in a market that is fast becoming a digital society.”Maukazuva further commented, “Being able to offer VOD allows our users to select and watch and listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows whenever they choose, rather than at a scheduled broadcast time. This will complement our leading print offerings. We are committed to investing into delivery of content to our loyal customers.”With the media and entertainment industry poised to experience growing shifts in viewing consumption and advertising spend on digital media at the expense of traditional print-based media, AMH is therefore attempting to reacw millions of internet users with their video on demand (VOD) and Webcasting services.Source: http://nextvnews.com/.
