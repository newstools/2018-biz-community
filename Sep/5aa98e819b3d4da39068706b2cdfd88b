Situated on Main Road in Sea Point, this digital screen has a long visibility run up and channels traffic coming from Hout Bay, Llandudno and Camps Bay heading towards Cape Town CBD, allowing advertisers to gain access to the emerging LSM market and get consistent coverage on the Atlantic Seaboard using DOOH,” says Simon Wall, Managing Director at Tractor Outdoor. “This is the first digital screen in Sea Point and we are extremely excited about this addition to the network as it reaffirms our status as the largest digital media owners within Cape Town. We are proud of the work we have done this far and look forward to further growth,” says Ben Harris, Rights and Development Director at Tractor Outdoor. Tractor Outdoor is currently offering advertisers the opportunity to advertise their brands on two digital deals that they are currently running for a limited time only.
