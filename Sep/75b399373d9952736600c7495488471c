Leading the pack of the brand marketers is Unilever’s Mbali Ndandani, Yum!’s Ben Schoderer and Tiger Brands’s Lunga Ngcime, all of whom are highly respected industry figures. “This year our judging panel represents some of the best minds in mobile from across South Africa,” says Utermark. “Winning a Smartie means your entry met our strict criteria of showing business results and impressed all 12 judges. While creativity is an important criteria to have met, as it engages consumers to act, proving a return on investment is essential to win.” The judges will critique each piece of work for strategy (20%), creativity (20%), execution (20%) and business impact (40%). Past winners have included Digitas Liquorice, Yonder and Gloo. “What each of these campaigns have in common is their quest to deliver tangible outcomes. Whether that is by using SMS, video or app downloads, the outcomes are clearly worth their financial investment,” says Utermark. All 2018 winners will also automatically be entered into the MMA’s Business Impact Index (BII) for its respective regions. The BII is the first and only global mobile marketing index that identifies, ranks and awards top agencies, advertisers, brands and technology enablers that drive significant business impact through mobile-first campaigns. BII winners per region will be announced in April 2019. “The value of a SMARTIE Award as well as the BII is broad. As a global organisation our judging criteria is world-class. This means winners are included among the very best from across the globe and is something to be extremely proud of,” concludes Utermark. Entries will be critiqued this week on 4 September and each judge will review all entries to choose their top 24 winners from the Marketing Objectives, Media and Technology categories. Winners will be announced on 1 November at the Smarties gala awards ceremony in partnership with BBM, Apps Flyer and Vicinity Media. It will be held at the Maslow Hotel in Sandton. This follows the New York City Awards on 1 October and is before the London event to be held at The Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington, on Tuesday, 22 November.
