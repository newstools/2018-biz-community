Having been trained in media and entertainment business management, I have a varied cross-disciplinary background. My new role at BRFC will see these skills being brought to the fore on a daily basis. My focus, in addition to motivating a team of talented, creative people is going to be delivering work that not only sets our clients apart from their competitors but also increasing their brand awareness in new target markets.”His hope is to build an agency that will reward and recognise people at their level of performance and not years of experience, contrary to what he has experienced working in ad agencies. “We seem to reward people for the years they’ve spent solving problems and not how quickly they can solve those problems.”Ndhlovu says he strongly believes in Black River FC and its legacy. “The agency has a rich history and I’m fortunate to be a part of that.” And he looks forward to driving the vision for Black River FC 2.0….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your new role and what it entails.It’s mostly about driving the vision for Black River FC 2.0 – that includes building a company where people can strive, walking the journey with our current clients and growing the agency’s client portfolio.

That’s where things are going; we are losing people at a rapid rate.The advertising business is going through changes but people are resistant to the change because they are benefiting from the status quo. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1612/373523-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Seems Cook and Kasu weren’t lying about their Checkers ‘little shop’ grocery collections…" width="120" height="120">#LoeriesRankings with Black River FCJust when you thought the Loeries buzz was over, the Loeries' rankings are in!
