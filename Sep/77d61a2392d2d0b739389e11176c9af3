This data set allows us to plan media based on engagement.“That data is building quickly. By March next year you will see some interesting products from us,” she added.ChangeAfrica is changing more quickly than we think she said. “No one is starting with a legacy as they are all leap frogging and starting from the beginning. Maybe South Africa’s advertising industry will experience some legacy issues, but not the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, which will go directly into a new model of advertising.”“Our aim is 200 million connected consumers in Sub Saharan Africa. If you think that the United States has 300 million personal IDs already, then, from an African perspective this is totally achievable,” she added.While Out of Home (OOH) investments levels in South Africa are very low (5%), in Kenya and Nigeria, they are much higher - 25% and 40% respectively. “When it comes to Digital Out of Home (DOOH) South Africa is even further behind at 2% compared to 10% in Kenya and 40% in Nigeria. Yet people are spending more and more time out of home,” Rowlands said.“If we can create an environment where we understand the people’s passion in these countries - and there is more to Africa then music and football - than we can create great content."We underestimate the effect that global and environmental trends are having on Africa, she told the audience. Geopolitical factors often led to a volatile environment.“When the elections in Ghana were postponed, our figures dropped by 40%. Geopolitical events/factor also have a massive effect on the economy.”Societal factors include cause marketing which is far more extreme in these environments. Technology is a huge factor. “Most people look at Africa and only see that most people are on feature phones. The reality is that most of the market has worked out how to communicate using less tech enabled devices. Technology challenges are only challenges if we allow them to be,” she stressed.“In addition, GDP growth and advertisement investment as well as ad spend shows that our business needs to change quite quickly. There is turmoil in our environment."In the near future, she believed that media companies will be consolidating across the Sub-Saharan African region.
