These are the people who have 7-10 years of experience and require very little guidance and management to get the job done. They just get on with the project. But what has happened is that these people have been burnt out, jaded or decided on a new career path and have left which means that the seniors in the business are having to step in and do the 'grunt' work.The juniors who should be mentored by the seniors are left to 'sink or swim' as they have limited exposure to the seniors.I am of the opinion that we need to stop the sweatshop mentality that exists and start encouraging these people back in some capacity, to add value to the businesses which will free up time for internal mentorship and growth..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}In terms of education and training, what are people’s options?There are a number of excellent schools, academies and online courses that an individual can take to upskill themselves in their field of interest. Most people think that just because they have a qualification that they are entitled to a big salary or a big title, which is certainly not the case.Theory is one thing and application is another. Attitude and passion will not be taught at a school or online. People taking these courses need to be willing to put their heads down and apply the learnt knowledge and get experience in their field to be able to add value..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Where did the idea for the academy come from?No one place but more of a need to help businesses and people solve a big problem and trying to make an impact on the local market. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who is looking for extra training more do you think – companies for their staff or individuals themselves?Individuals are always keen to learn more but are limited by funds. Corporates have the budgets for training but at times it’s not being used effectively for their teams’ growth or where the business is going..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Do you have any advice for young professionals entering the industry? Be prepared to work hard. Be prepared to sweat it out and learn from all those around you. Everybody has something to teach you and every day is a learning day, so be a sponge and absorb as much as you can..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What else can you tell us about the academy?The academy offers Seta-accredited, digital marketing education to businesses, agencies and individuals.
