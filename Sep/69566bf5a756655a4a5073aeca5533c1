It is pertinent that the theme for this year’s BASA awards is ‘Legacy’ because there is no doubt that Michelle leaves an extraordinary legacy in the ongoing task to bring the creative sector into its rightful place in the mainstream economy. The awards also afford our more than 120 members - and the arts community broadly - a wonderful opportunity to celebrate with Michelle.”  Citing the need for new energy to take BASA forward and her own desire to explore fresh frontiers, Constant expressed her deep appreciation for her time at the internationally recognised South African development agency.  “I have had an extraordinary 10 years at BASA and have truly grown to love the organisation,” stated Constant. “During my decade at BASA, I have witnessed the difference it makes in the arts sector - not just in South Africa but on the continent, something that was gratifyingly apparent at my most recent presentations in Namibia and in Ethiopia at the African Union.  “I believe that, together with the Department of Arts & Culture, the board, a diverse team and various sectors including business and tourism, we have built up a healthy and vibrant organisation. I look forward to welcoming my successor to what is a truly meaningful and deeply rewarding position within the arts-business landscape.”  Constant joined BASA in 2008, and, under her stewardship, the agency has grown into an important one on the continent and beyond. Its current suite of integrated programmes, for both businesses and arts practitioners and organisations, as well as research, toolkits and other elements of BASA’s growing Knowledge Hub are testament to Constant’s vision and the robust team she has built. The past decade has seen the implementation of several important partnerships that have helped fulfil BASA’s mission to ensure the relevance and sustainability of the arts in South Africa by providing expertise in the development of partnerships between business and the arts.  Says le Roux: “Having the luxury of such a strong foundation and six months to appoint a successor, is indicative of Michelle’s leadership. Our HR board committee has already met to start the recruitment process and we are excited for the next BASA chapter.”   About BASA Business and Arts South Africa NPC (BASA) is an internationally recognised South African development agency with a suite of integrated programmes implemented nationally and internationally.
