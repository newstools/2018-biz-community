Struan Campbell, Co-founder at Levergy, said, “After an immensely successful 2017, we are proud to continue to have had our work recognised throughout this year. We take pride in our ability to create innovative, yet simple campaigns for our clients – these awards are evidence of that. We would like to thank our clients for their continued support and will strive to continue to produce industry-leading work going forward.” Levergy’s 2018 recognition comes across multiple marketing disciplines including PR, social media, sponsorship, branded content and integrated campaigns. A reflection of the efforts invested by the agency to create a full-service marketing offering. “While we specialise in the leveraging of sport and entertainment sponsorships, we take pride in the broad offering we have built. To have claimed a total of ten awards so far in 2018, going up against the best creative agencies in the country, all across multiple industry events and disciplines, is evidence of the unique to our industry, through-the-line offering we have created at Levergy. We are excited about the continued evolution of the agency will strive to continue this success into the future,” added Levergy CEO Clint Paterson.
