Through its relaxed personality-driven format, the channel’s anchors will weigh in on the top stories, share their opinions and engage with viewers in real time. Nisa Allie, Managing Director of Open News, believes that the channel will fill a gap in the current television news market, “Open News will offer viewers an entirely new way of experiencing the news. Sharing the screen with our anchors is a team of savvy video journalists, who will approach news in a fresh, punchy, fluid and engaging way. Using the latest technology, we are moving away from the traditional format and merging television news with social media.” Open News will broadcast from a brand-new interactive studio in Cape Town, which has been designed to enable anchors to draw on content from multiple platforms. In addition to politics, crime and courts, Open News will take a keen interest in what is trending and going viral, delving into showbiz, celebrity and sport. “As the first local news channel on the Openview platform, Open News is an exciting addition to our offering,” says Marlon Davids, Managing Director of e.tv channels. “It’s not just a first for Openview, but also a first for the country. For the first time, free-to-air viewers will truly be able to experience the news in a lively, interactive and unrestrained way.” Open News will broadcast from 5pm on Thursday, 1 November, on Openview channel 120. Outside of the six hours, the channel has partnered with international broadcasters, who will provide content from a global perspective.
