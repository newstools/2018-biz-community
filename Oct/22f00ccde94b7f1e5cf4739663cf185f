Which soul are you feeding tonight?" width="350" height="350">In all of us, lies the constant struggle between what is right and wrong. Lust, gluttony, sex, greed, are all considered bad but they feel so good. So why fight it? Why not, instead, celebrate the push and pull of what we consider good and bad?After the success of Marble Restaurant, which opened in 2016, it made sense that restaurant owner and chef, David Higgs and businessman, Gary Kyriacou, would approach Grid again when looking to open a second restaurant. From the outset, Grid worked hand in hand with the team and interior designer, Irene Kyriacou, to define the core intention of the brand and bring it to life through all touch points. Saint believes that the battle that has been waged since time immemorial – the battle of right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, saint vs. sinner, abstinence vs. decadence – is a man-made construct born of a conservative mind. Designed to constrain and confine, it aims to curb our most primal desires and deny that which makes us most human – the pleasures of the flesh.But Saint knows right needs wrong. There can be no good in the absence of evil. Light cannot be if there is no dark. Saint exists to entice and incite. It invites people to defy convention, break the bonds of dictated norms and free their minds. It encourages them to forget their inhibitions, set aside judgment, surrender to their instincts and discover an enlightened understanding of virtue and vice. To bring this idea to life, the restaurant is built around an unexpected fusion of contrasting ideas - An ancient love (pizza/Italian/the familiarity/the smells/the ingredients) fused with contemporary, fresh, trendy modern-day dining. The competitive landscape says we can have either old world Italian OR modern 'fast' Italian. We say we can have both in a space that is curious and provocative. Rebellious and original. Seductive and adventurous. Saint is about the pleasure of free thinking, the virtue of vice.
