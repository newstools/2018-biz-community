Months went by and more and more local entrepreneurs surfaced with the same vision and passion to pursue their own small business. This was when Ebrahim realised there was a gap in the small business market.

Months went by, more and more local entrepreneurs surfaced with the same vision and passion to pursue their own small business. This was when it clicked, there’s a gap in this industry!   All these local entrepreneurs are so passionate and dedicated to making their business work and believe that their product or service is unique and different from the rest, however, they are not aware of the importance of PR and strategic networking events to create a buzz around their business and to grow their customer base. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are some of the obstacles you've had to overcome since starting out? Starting a business in this huge industry is extremely intimidating without a doubt, but believing in the brand and what it stands for is what motivates me to continue this journey.Businesses or clients tend to shy away from startups, especially of this nature and breaking through that wall is still an obstacle. You constantly need to push and push until you’re heard. This is how your client base can be established..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you give to other aspiring entrepreneurs?Hesitation can cause you many regrets. The whole world can tell you not to, but if you believe in your idea, go for it - it’s yours, own it! The key to the success of your business is determination and persistence.

The perception needs to be changed and opportunities need to increase..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you believe are the traits an entrepreneur needs in order to succeed?

Making sure we have engaged with the right clients that will support our sustainability in the industry. As I have mentioned before, it is not our intention to focus on working towards being among the big names in the industry but linking in with organisations who will have had a success story that Xact was significantly part of. I believe this will put us in a league of our own.Also, probably set up in a little office with an employee or two who share the same vision as Xact.For more, go to https://xactcomms.wixsite.com/eventssetTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
