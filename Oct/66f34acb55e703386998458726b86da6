Where do you live, work and play? Live: RondeboschWork: ClaremontPlay: All over the world, much to my husband’s distress. Preferably on a mountain with skis on my feet, on the beach or in the bush somewhere. 2. What’s your claim to fame? Whether it’s the fact that I have a nephew older than me, or that I was the first Zimbabwean ski instructor in Colorado, or that I once sent a very risqué CV by mistake to the whole South African media and marketing industry… I’m not sure. 3. Describe your career so far. My first seven years working was spent in the agency world. I especially loved my time at Publicis Machine. The last three years I have spent running and nurturing my own business, which I love for a whole host of different reasons. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things.

Working from atop the Oloololo Escarpment, overlooking the Mara Triangle with the migration teeming beneath her.I also enjoy being that silent PR engine, working in the background to help our clients achieve their business goals. By doing this we help them get more customers, sell more product, get more people to their site, etc. Whatever it is that’s keeping them up at night – we help them solve by helping them find their voice, be heard and stand out. 6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. I spend the first hour or two with my son – usually reading books or dancing around to The Greatest Showman soundtrack.  I then grab a coffee on the way into the office, where we have a morning status meeting. Meet with a client or two, liaise with media, write/edit some work, grab a Woolies’ on-the-go-lunch, and then back to the office for a few more hours before heading home to pick up my son and take him for a run in the park! 7. What are the tools of your trade? We start with written content, our networks and really strong coffee. Depending on the client and the task at hand, we also use Newsclip Media Monitoring, WordPress, Canva and Xero, which help in making our lives much easier.  8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Gone Digital. They're a client of mine but they are getting the agency model right by keeping things simple. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459557-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Peters captions this: “My golfing bucket list. #Scotland”" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

List a few pain points the industry can improve on. There are a lot of people out there who don’t understand what PR is and what it can do for you.
