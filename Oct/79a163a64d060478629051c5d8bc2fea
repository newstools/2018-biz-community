A custom built #CokeScoreChallenge studio co-hosted by SABC 1 presenters featured inserts promoting the competition and educating viewers around the entry mechanic. Product placement of the ‘Score Packaging’ was used at half time and full time to reflect the score in the match. The #CokeScoreChallenge was a Twitter-based score prediction campaign, integrated into the live broadcast of all 44 FIFA World Cup™ games on SABC. Fans could enter by posting a tweet of themselves using Coca-Cola ®‘Score Packaging’ to predict the score using #CokeScoreChallenge @CocaCola_ZA. Correct scores were entered into a daily draw to win cash prizes.  The campaign reached over 20 million viewers, with paid posts on Facebook delivering the highest reach of all Coca-Cola® FIFA World Cup™ campaigns in South Africa. The #CokeScoreChallenge campaign organically trended and became the leading conversation topic around the FIFA World Cup™ for Coca-Cola® in South Africa. Globally, the campaign was consistently in the top 10 most used Coca-Cola® hashtags and was twice the best performing Coca-Cola® FIFA World Cup™ hashtag during the tournament. “The results for the campaign have been phenomenal for the brand. The FIFA World Cup™ is a key global asset for Coca-Cola and we are proud that South Africa featured so strongly in the global conversation around the event,” said Justine Cullinan, Coca-Cola South Africa’s Head of IMC. “As Playmakers, we are very proud that we have been able to elevate Coca-Cola South Africa’s FIFA World Cup™ campaign into a global conversation. We would like to thank Coca-Cola for their support of our agency and for this campaign. Without them and their incredible digital and social media team, this campaign would not have been possible. After many years of driving media innovation in the sponsorship space, we are delighted that our work has been recognised at the highest level in the media industry and we humbly thank the AMASA Awards for this acknowledgement. We have decided to create a greater focus around our media offering and look forward to making an exciting announcement around this soon,” said Matt Ellenbogen, Playmakers Managing Director.  The agency also received the Highly Commended Award for the Best Experiential/Event executed for the Jaguar Land Rover Two Icons Tour.
