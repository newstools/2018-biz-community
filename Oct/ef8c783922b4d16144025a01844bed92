Hence, the bird not hiding in the bush, but confidently in flight. Loeries represents creative excellence. It’s the awards show that reminds us that creativity is a currency and when executed to its full potential, brands, agencies and individuals thrive,” (Nathan Reddy, founder and CEO of Grid Worldwide and Loeries 2017 Hall of Fame inductee). The updated brand assets really come alive in a fresh and modern way with the Loerie bird featuring as the brands centre piece. Apart from an identity change, there was a corresponding campaign that required development… 40 years is an amazing milestone and that may make you wonder, where did all that great creative work ever go? Does it live on in an annual or simply become a trophy on a shelf? We explored these various questions and came up with one conclusion - all great creative work goes to Creative Heaven and only the most iconic and award-winning work gets to go through those pearly white gates. And so, a nostalgic journey began where we showcased past winners from the last 40 years, enjoying the creative afterlife. The task of bringing Creative Heaven ‘to life’ was given to Spitfire Productions and it was a fun one. Not only did we get to recreate scenes from iconic ads such as BMW’s ‘Mouse’, but the series of ads also featured the original cast and in some cases, the animators, from the original productions. The campaign line - ‘Eternal greatness awaits” – puts into context the prestigiousness of the event with the aim of motivating brands and agencies to develop work which results in eternal greatness. Outside of the campaign, there was a branding requirement in and around the event space that Grid was also tasked with solving. We used the Loeries core sponsors (DSTV, Gearhouse, City of Durban, KZN Province and Tsogo Sun) and what it is their key product offerings are to inform the events visual language. Although the system was based off of the sponsors brands, the branding approach came to life in a subtle yet very bold way.
