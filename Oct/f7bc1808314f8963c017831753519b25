It was not only evident from our record number of visitors but also by our very pleased exhibitors. This inaugural expo, exceeded our expectation and is a great foundation for future events, we cannot wait to start planning the next one!”.Packed with inspirational ideas and features, including highlights such as The Kitchen Theatre, The Concrete Workshop, d’VINE life, Live By Design and Nesting vs Nguni Sky, the Expo offered everything your heart desires for your home projects. The Kitchen Theatre was packed during the back to back sensational chef demonstrations. Chefs cooked with the prime meat cuts from The SPAR Steak Co. and could not keep the visitors away from these amazing tasters. Van Loveren wines showed visitors how you can create a party in the mouth with their delightful wine pairings. The Concrete Workshop was a new addition to the expo, offering a creative space for craftsmen, makers and designers to engage with visitors and demonstrate the many uses of concrete.  It was an absolute treat to see the concrete experts from World of Decorative Concrete show off their applied tips.The Pretoria Homemakers Expo is proudly presented by Homemakers Media Holdings, presenting four home lifestyle events in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Port Elizabeth, reaching 100,000 visitors every year.Thank you to our show sponsors: Jacaranda FM, SPAR Steak Company, SPAR, Van Loveren Wines, Adams Discount Centre, Lumen Lights, The Gas Company, Stone by Design, Inspire Furniture Hire.See the Expo videos here or view the photo gallery here:For more information, call 086 111 4663 or visit www.homemakersonline.co.za Twitter – @SAHomemakers		Facebook – www.facebook.com/HOMEMAKERSonlineInstagram – HOMEMAKERS_Expo	#hmexpo
