Our digital focus for Sawubona will be based on a targeted, intelligent content distribution strategy with the aim of providing prospective travellers with information that adds value and helps them with their travel planning.”The agency has an established background within the in-flight publishing sector and brings this experience to the editorial front. Desireé explains that as media moves from the information to the reputational age, Mikateko Media will prioritise stories from real people and real travellers. “We want to unlock the value of real advice from real travellers,” she says. She and her team also plan to stimulate positive conversation around South Africa and SAA, showcasing the country’s extraordinary talent and offerings to both local and international travellers.

It also takes a village of talented people to win an account like Sawubona and I salute everyone who gave their all.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/460929-625x411.jpg" alt="Mikateko Media wins SAA, Sawubona account" width="625" height="411" rel="">click to enlargeSays Tlali Tlali, SAA spokesperson: “Sawubona is an award-winning and well-established title that deserves to take further flight.
