<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/463888.jpg" alt="#ShovaForHope - 4 heroes, 106km, 2 charities, 1 goal" width="400" height="400">Three of Expand A Sign’s team is embarking on the gruelling 106km Amashova cycle race on a single-speedy bicycle this weekend.  As uncomfortable as their bikes are, they are pushing themselves in a fundraiser and awareness drive for Operation Bobbi Bear and iThemba Lethu. Operation Bobbi Bear is a human rights organisation committed to helping sexually abused children in Amanzimtoti in KwaZulu-Natal and iThemba Lethu helps restore hope and destiny in vulnerable children through various programmes, including Family Integration, Breast Milk Bank and HIV Prevention. We obviously can’t begin to tell you the full story of the incredible work these organisations are doing in our local communities, so check out their respective websites - http://bobbibear.org.za/ and https://www.ithembalethu.org.za/. Get involved and make a difference We are looking for as little as a R20 donation to Operation Bobbi Bear or iThemba Lethu in order to reach our donation goal of R100,000. Share #ShovaForHope and get your team or family and friends involved in sending motivational messages to the Expand A Sign team cycling.
