Feldman adds:The political murder of anyone is horrendous. The murder of a journalist for his views is outrageous. Killing someone on foreign soil with the aid of a power-tool, nail clippers and a body double has the making of a far-fetched movie. And yet it does seem that this is what happened. Khashoggi was admittedly a harsh critic of the Saudi government. And according to EWN, when delivering the ‘naked truth’ Erdogan said Turkish investigators had evidence that Khashoggi was the victim of a premeditated “savage murder,” by a 15-man hit squad. No accidental physical brawl, then.Who protects the reporters who protect us?So while Sky News reports that Khashoggi’s body parts have since been found in a garden 500m from the consulate, the mystery over his killing, and the link to media freedom, is far from over.In fact, October seems to be the month for media freedom in the spotlight, as it also marks the first anniversary of Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia's assassination by car bomb.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/464055-120x120.jpg?1" alt="A South African's guide to moving to and making it in Malta: Sign 'O' the Times" width="120" height="120">A South African's guide to moving to and making it in Malta: Sign 'O' the TimesThis month's anniversary of Maltese journalist-blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia's assassination has undammed a flow of reportage, ruminations and reminiscences...By Marcus 'The Maltese Falcon' Brewster 19 Oct 2018Galizia’s famous last words live on: “the situation is desperate, there are crooks everywhere you look”.The Citizen adds that instead of blaming Saudi Prince Riyadh directly, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “preferred to authorise the leak of incriminating information to pro-government media to put pressure on the kingdom.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/435826-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The World Press Freedom Index 2017 by ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Grave press freedom violations in AfricaFreedom of speech, long seen as a mainstay of the Western world, isn't necessarily a given elsewhere, especially when you criticise government policy and work in the media...By Leigh Andrews 9 Apr 2018Click here to read Khashoggi’s last Washington Post column, which the publication’s global opinions editor, Karen Attiah, received from Khashoggi’s translator and assistant the day after he was reported missing. Attiah says, “This column perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world. A freedom he apparently gave his life for.”All the more proof that media freedom remains under threat, but killing the journalist does not kill the story.
