A Star Is BornIn this new take on the tragic love story, Bradley Cooper plays seasoned musician Jackson Maine, who discovers - and falls in love with - struggling artist Ally (Lady Gaga). She has just about given up on her dream to make it big as a singer until Jack coaxes her into the spotlight. But even as Ally’s career takes off, the personal side of their relationship is breaking down, as Jack fights an ongoing battle with his own internal demons.The cast of A Star is Born also includes Andrew Dice Clay with Dave Chappelle and Sam Elliott. In addition to playing Ally, Gaga, who earned her Oscar nod for the song ‘Til It Happens to You from The Hunting Ground, performs original songs in the film, which she wrote with Cooper and a handful of artists, including Lukas Nelson, Jason Isbell, and Mark Ronson.  All the music is original and was recorded live.It marks the third remake of the original 1937 film, which was adapted into 1954 musical and then remade as a 1976 rock musical with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Putting his own stamp on the tale with his contemporary take on A Star Is Born, director-writer Cooper strove to make something that speaks to the timeless nature of human feelings and failings, mixed with today’s diverse world of music.Read more about A Star is Born here.Hell FestOn Halloween night, three young women and their respective boyfriends head to Hell Fest - a ghoulish travelling carnival that features a labyrinth of rides, games, and mazes.
