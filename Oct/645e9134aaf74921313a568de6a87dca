With 16 brands mentioned a total of 27 times across 18 different categories, FCB Africa group’s clients certainly proved their marketing mettle.In particular, FCB Africa clients accounted for the three major awards in the consumer section of the survey with Koo receiving the Grand Prix as the Overall Favourite Brand, and Coca-Cola taking the Social Investment Award and the Green Award.In fact, three FCB Africa clients made it to the Top 10 Overall Favourite Brand list (Koo, Coca-Cola and Tastic Rice), two made it to the Top 10 Social Investment list (Coca-Cola and Tiger Brands) and two to the Top 10 Green list (Coca-Cola and Tiger Brands).In addition, Tastic Rice was named the number one brand in the Essential Foods consumer category, Koo the number one brand in the Tinned Goods consumer category, and Coca-Cola the number 1 brand in the Soft Drinks consumer category. FCB Africa brands achieving number two positions included Savanna Dry in the Cider consumer category and Toyota in the Car Companies business category.Other FCB Africa brands acknowledged by the survey were Albany, Amarula, Sprite, FishAways, Sunlight Soap, Ingrams, Mrs Balls, Debonairs Pizza, Absa and Sasol.Based on this performance, FCB Africa was the runner up for the Robyn Putter Award. This recognises the contributions made by creative agencies in support of winning brands, with the winner decided on a points system, based on the performance of its clients in the survey.“We are exceptionally proud of our clients and their brands. This is a phenomenal performance proving their professionalism and commitment to South African consumers and, in the case of those making the Grand Prix lists, to issues that are important to those consumers,” said FCB Africa Group CEO, Brett Morris.“Congratulations to them all, especially seeing as – for most of them – this is not their first time achieving Grand Prix status, nor making the category lists. Consistency and commitment, staying the distance, is vital when it comes to brand building, and these 16 brands have certainly proved they’ve got what it takes to deliver.”Morris also commended the agency teams that worked closely with FCB Africa’s clients to support their brand-building efforts. “I’m very pleased to see such a wide spread of clients and brands making the lists, and across such a wide spread of different categories. I believe this demonstrates FCB Joburg’s, FCB Cape Town’s and Hellocomputer’s experience and depth, which obviously translates into adding value for our clients and brands.”
