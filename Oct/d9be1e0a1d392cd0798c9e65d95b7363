We’re seeing a clear creative competition going on between the fast food brands, Nando’s, Chicken Licken and KFC.  What’s so great about some of the approaches from Nando’s and Chicken Licken is that they have engaged their consumers with strong story-telling, focusing less about the brand’s functional / tactical and practical information / price points.  Make no mistake, South Africans love to hear about the functional messages from a brand – but these ads are great examples of how to create a strong, emotional and meaningful impressions in our consumers’ minds. South African’s have become accustomed to Nando’s creative approach that takes a poke at life in South Africa and makes us laugh at ourselves (we need that).  It’s this creative style and the way that Nando’s risks it all walking a fine line between appropriate and inappropriate - that has landed this ad in first place.  A great example of understanding and engaging our South African consumers. We also see quite a few car brands for a change, and a couple of global agencies highlighting the ads ability to cross borders and still engage in another market..kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:none; font-size:12px;} #1 AD Q1 2018  #1 AD Q2 2018 Nando’s: We can fix our S#*t | MC Saatchi AbelKFC: Travellator | Ogilvy Johannesburg .kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px; font-size:12px;}RANKBEST LIKED AD | Q1 2018CREATIVE AGENCY1Nando’s “We can fix our S#*t”M&C Saatchi Abel2Kia Sportage 4x4 “The Harrisons”Old Friends Young Talent3VW Polo “Red flashy thing”Ogilvy Cape Town4Oreo Biscuits “Oreo dunk challenge – Shaquille O’Neal’s acrobat skills”The Martin Agency5Samsung Galaxy S9 “The camera.
