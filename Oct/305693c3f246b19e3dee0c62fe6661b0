Business Positioning Systems (BPS) handle reviews across a number of platforms and are finding Google My Business to be, surprisingly, one of the biggest and most important review environments. Here’s why:1) The quality of review. Unlike social platforms, that can be simply places to complain, users tend to post both positive and negative reviews, and suggestions. As GMB is a ‘business before social’ platform users provide insights and comment on what’s working as opposed to getting on their soapboxes and complaining for their social network.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/466087-625x366.png" alt="Your online reputation precedes you" width="625" height="366" rel="">click to enlarge2) Reviews on GMB greatly impact search performance. Its estimated that 10% of Google ranking is based on reviews. More reviews equal more views, leading to more reviews…it’s a snowball effect that can be extremely positive (or devastating) for any business.3) GMB is rapidly growing in popularity as a reputational platform. A number of big brands, especially in the QSR sector are seeing GMB reviews outpacing other social review platforms like Facebook. One reason for this is that on GMB users are communicating directly with the local store (or they believe they are) instead of a central brand page that feels a million miles away.Handle your GMB reviews the BPS wayAt BPS all our client’s reviews are synced into our Location Bank software platform.
