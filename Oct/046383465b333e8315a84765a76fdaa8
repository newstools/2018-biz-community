After the suspect fled into the taxi rank crowd, a stabbing of a female took place. The back-up arrived, and the suspect was detained by the Hot Squad. SAPS placed the suspect under arrest. The stabbing victim was also attended to by the paramedics. The driver of the vehicle who experienced the attempted forced entry has been traced and will be laying a charge at SAPS Douglasdale. There is now one less perpetrator on our streets. Well done to the Hot Squad and thank you for all the work you are doing to make our city safer. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/461673-625x469.jpg" alt="Hot Squad and SAPS arrest suspect for attempted smash-and-grab and stabbing" width="625" height="469"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/461674-625x469.jpg" alt="Hot Squad and SAPS arrest suspect for attempted smash-and-grab and stabbing" width="625" height="469">
