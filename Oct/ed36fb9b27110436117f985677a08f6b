So, if you’re at that point, how do you make sure that you get the most out of your pitch process and the agencies you select to participate?<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/461220.jpg" alt="(c) ammentorp -" width="625" height="417">(c) ammentorp - 123RF.comThe first thing to consider is the incumbent relationship.

That way they can check they’ll be able to resource the pitch – and the business – properly, but they’ll also start to get an idea of what you would be like to work with.

Indeed, the best pitches result in the final decision being extremely difficult. But to ensure all pitching agencies are hungry, competitive and focused on winning your business, you need to make the process as open, thoughtful, engaging and motivating as possible, and that takes time, commitment and a degree of creativity on your part too.
