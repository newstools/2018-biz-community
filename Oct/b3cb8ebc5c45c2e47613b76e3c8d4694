The theme for this year’s event is ‘Logic & Magic’ so Bongani and Mags really seem to epitomise this with their combined experience in marketing and entertainment, as well as their quirky humour as a duo.”Bongani Mtolo, who holds the title of the Best Afternoon Drive Presenter on commercial radio, says they are honoured, “As the industry Drive show movers and shakers in audio and visual entertainment media, we are stoked to have been selected to host the awards evening.”His co-host, both on air and at the awards ceremony, Mags Westerhof says, “We will bring the flare and the synergy we share daily between 3-6pm on East Coast Radio. Guests can expect bizazz, elegance, style and there will most certainly be a dash of South African humour.”This year’s AMASA awards have received a record number of entries and will also be adding Agency of the Year to the list of categories.
