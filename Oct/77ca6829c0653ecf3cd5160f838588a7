They are connectivity startup BRCK, which has designed a weatherproof, shockproof and battery-powered modem that can provide internet at 3G speeds to up to 100 devices at a time; and Ona, which uses satellite imagery and information from NGOs to create a simple digital mapping system.Nigeria’s Babymigo, an online community that connects mothers-to-be with information, medical experts, services and other parents, also makes the cut, as does Ghana’s Bitland, which uses blockchain technology to create tamper-proof digital public records to help people prove their land belongs to them.South Africa is represented by two companies, nutrient recycling tartup AgriProtein and Wonderbag, which has developed a heavily insulated container that functions as a non-electric, go-anywhere slow cooker.
