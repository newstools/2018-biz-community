There are many models and methods for doing it, depending what you want to achieve. Your top reasons are very likely lead generation, boosting website and landing page traffic, and trying to boost SEO scores. Maybe you also want to leverage some LinkedIn user accounts of key personnel, perhaps a Facebook campaign can boost a recruitment effort targeting varsity graduates, or maybe you want a newsletter to populate a marketing lead qualifier campaign. And you’ve probably heard and understood the solid advice that says start small and replicate what succeeds rather than taking a big bang approach to digital. But how do you attend all the sales meetings, management meetings, marketing meetings, comms sessions, mine the new data you’re collecting, create the reports, drive the many campaigns, attend and even host events, and meet all your other responsibilities while also creating content? PR companies, unlike ad agencies, have typically helped time-stressed CMOs and marketers fine-tune their strategies and populate the campaigns with longer form content to which ad industry copy writers are unsuited. But B2B organisations often deal with complex technical topics few writers can readily grasp. Trying to explain dense topics can be a challenge - the subject matter experts simply don’t have the time for and which can reflect badly on marketing. You need content creators who quickly grasp topics and extract knowledge from subject matter experts. They must be able to quickly turn that into marketable angles and written content that looks like the experts themselves wrote it.
