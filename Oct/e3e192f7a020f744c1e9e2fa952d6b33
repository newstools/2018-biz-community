The outcome of the evening is a beautiful collection of well over 1,000 drawings that will be auctioned at Barrows during November. Proceeds from the auction will go towards a scholarship for talented, yet disadvantaged, students to study at Vega with a portion being donated to 1000drawings.org. Bring your art tools and be inspired! Friday, 19 October, from 6pm. Book your free tickets on Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/night-of-a-1000-drawings-durban-doodle-evening-tickets-50771598217.
