Denver Apollus has been promoted to Head of Radio Innovation, a role which he describes as “bringing together the Programming and Marketing departments in a way that creates exhilarating content for our listeners, whilst delivering on key objectives for clients”. Overseeing strategic programming and marketing of the station is a natural progression for Apollus, who has worked in the broadcasting industry, particularly radio, over the past two decades. His wealth of experience has seen him initiate some of the most exciting station activations to date, with the most recent being the #ManagementChallenges which demonstrates how radio can be brought “to life” in extraordinary, integrated ways. Apollus says, “Taking over as Programme Manager at Heart FM in 2013 was a great challenge and one that came at the right time in my career. By dreaming big and undertaking more crazy, weird and almost impossible stunts, we will consistently redefine broadcast activations and the audience experience.” Strategies like this have seen the station’s fiercely loyal audience reach over 800,000 listeners, taking Heart FM to the number-one position in the Western Cape in the past two years. Managing Director Renee Redelinghuys says these new positions are key to the station’s strategy going forward and the future of radio is exhilarating. “We have worked hard at becoming Cape Town’s number-one station, but the challenge now is to remain in this position and continue on this trajectory. This can only be achieved by putting the right people in the right roles, which will deliver impactful radio for all our stakeholders." Renowned name in radio, Vernon Carver, has been appointed as Programme Manager. No stranger to the airwaves, Carver has been on and off air since 2007. His illustrious career has seen him in various roles from Music Compiler to Production Engineer, On-Air Presenter, as well as his latest role as Music Manager. Carver has been a part of the team that has taken the station to its number-one spot in the Cape and says he believes it’s down to the fact that Heart FM “speaks the language of Capetonians”. Apollus says, “This is a well-deserved promotion for Vernon. We believe it’s the right time for him to take the lead and steer the team in the right direction. His exposure to all facets of the industry, from record companies to talent, artists and labels, he has exactly the right temperament and skillset for the job, and we are very proud of him.” Advertising is often a neglected component and many in the radio industry may not have “cracked” the balance of on-point messaging and innovative content. However, over the past few years Nick Feinberg has instilled a creative culture at Heart FM by appointing a pool of great talent and fostering and environment where creatives are able to express themselves whilst staying true to the integrity of client objectives. Feinberg steps into his new position as Creative Director after many years in the content space. Feinberg believes that, “Despite a world of on-demand television, radio podcasts and selective consumption, radio is as strong as ever. If not bigger than ever.” He continues, “We always try to push the envelope by creating ads that capture the attention of our listeners.”
