It’s the first Best of Bloem Award for Big Breakfast presenter Van der Merwe, and sixth consecutive year in a row that the breakfast programme on OFM wins this award.  It is also the station’s sixth consecutive win. Says OFM General Manager, Nick Efstathiou: “Winning in three categories in such a prestigious competition as the Best of Bloemfontein Awards is always a huge honour, especially because it’s an accolade purely bestowed on us by the residents of Bloemfontein. We never take for granted that they allow us into their homes, cars and offices and we take our job of providing entertainment and information very seriously.  Congratulations to Martin and his Big Breakfast team for once again making the station proud!” Bloemfontein Courant launched the Best of Bloemfontein competition in 2013.  Readers can vote in more than 70 categories which covers a range of industries.  Winning businesses and personalities receive a certificate of merit. This year’s results was announced at a special breakfast event for all the winners. A list of all the winners in all categories are available at www.bestofbloemfontein.co.za.
