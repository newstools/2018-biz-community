The brand was the first to sign up with AdColony in the region and utilise its trademark Aurora technology – offering interactive video engagement. “The client sought mass reach, engagement and innovation with measured results,” says AdColony South Africa’s Michelle Randall, Senior Account. “The campaign was created with two separate videos. Through the innovative Aurora offering consumers could literally flip between the two brand-centric videos. AdColony also incorporated Haptic Technology so that when consumers switched between videos, their phones vibrated. This allowed Heineken to deliver an impactful full sensory experience in high-definition quality.” The video was watched to completion 902,965 times with 58% of those being unique users. The Aurora interactive experience generated an engagement rate of 88.28%, and 8,620 users who completed the video, also engaged with the end card for an average of 4.2 seconds, resulting in 603 minutes of earned media. Over and above this, Heineken, sold 67,329hl (hectolitres) of beer, a year-on-year value growth of 424% and year-on-year volume growth of 610%. Heineken also saw a 2% increase in brand awareness and became the number-one purchased alcohol for the full campaign period. “We are so thrilled to have won Gold for this campaign and extend massive thanks to Cuan Bergan from Dentsu Redstar and Ilse Gräbe from Heineken for driving this campaign and of course the incredible team at AdColony who exceed expectations every day,” she says. “Working with the Heineken brand on this campaign has highlighted the way forward for many of our campaigns. Reaching an effective mass audience and capturing people’s attention is the foundation of successful advertising. "As a brand AdColony doesn't sell advertising but rather partners with brands to deliver exceptional campaign results and offer world-class technologies to implement innovations such as Aurora. The results so far have been incredible, and we look forward to implementing many more innovative campaigns for our clients."
