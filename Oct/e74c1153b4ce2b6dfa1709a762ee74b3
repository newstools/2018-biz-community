Only ethically sourced, uniquely African ingredients have been used in the new variant, which is infused with Madagascan vanilla extracts and African ginger to create a spicier, smoother and more luxuriant drink. The hint of spice found in the liqueur is combined with the subtle notes of vanilla and the exotic, natural Marula fruit for a rich and smooth taste.According to Amarula, the latest innovation is the first of a series of extensions that "represents an unexpected, sleek, modern and exotic side of Africa". Vanilla Spice is suited for a late night indulgence, after-dinner treat or lazy afternoons in front of a crackling fire while toasting marshmallows – it is the ideal warmer on cooler days. Enjoy on its own, poured over ice, shaken into hot drinks or in baked desserts.Amarula Vanilla Spice is now available in leading liquor stockists.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459344-120x120.jpg?3" alt="#FreshOnTheShelf: New Doritos, edible cookie dough, Nuy gin and Bosjes vino" width="120" height="120">#FreshOnTheShelf: New Doritos, edible cookie dough, Nuy gin and Bosjes vinoIn #FreshOnTheShelf, we round up some of our favourite food and beverage products that have hit the shelves recently...By Lauren Hartzenberg 20 Sep 2018Frost PopsiclesFrost Popsicles, creators of premium alcohol-based popsicles in South Africa, is ushering in summer with a host of new popsicle flavours, including the brand’s first non-alcoholic creations in response to fast-growing demand from the market.The five new flavours comprise:• Passion Fruit & Peach Margarita: Made with 100% natural peach and passion fruit flavour extracts.
