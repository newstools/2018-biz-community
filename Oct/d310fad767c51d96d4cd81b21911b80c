While South Africa is not unique, we need to sit back, reflect, and set critical talent management measures. In this article, I will explain why it is important to manage talent for the future and what you need to prioritise today to start doing this successfully.There is no longer one or two, but rather three talent management dimensions to look atToday, any established South African company can have a workforce consisting of up to three generations – Generation X, Generation Y (Millennials), and Generation Z. In short, Generation X is a group of individuals born between 1962 and 1979. They are at an age where they are moving into senior management positions and would prefer matching benefits, job security and opportunities for work-life balance. In contrast, Generation Y, also known as Millennials (born between 1980 and 1994), view the work they do as a personal expression and have a desire to understand how their efforts fit within the big picture of a company. These individuals hold a global perspective and easily accept diversity, actively seeking flexible working arrangements, paid time off and complete control over their schedule. Generation Z consists of people who were born in 1995 or later.HR practitioners will mainly interact with two different talent pools – Generation X and Generation Y, as Generation Z may still be completing their studies or only beginning to enter the job market.Gaining and retaining talent will help you deliver incremental people ROIAccording to the Deloitte Millennial Survey, 43% of millennials envision leaving their jobs within two years, while only 28% seek to stay beyond five years. Generation X employees also tend to change jobs every three to five years (Source: Entrepreneur Magazine).Sourcing and keeping talent onboard is, therefore, crucial for HR professionals. Without a talent management strategy on how to deal with a multi-generational workforce, businesses can’t expect to deliver a people-driven formula to measure ROI. The main reason is that employees of all age groups perform better when they are trained and mentored; excellence can only be achieved through constant improvement. Learning and development should, therefore, always be a priority. Having cost-efficient, in-house programmes to train and deploy talent without loss of time can be highly beneficial to a business.Aside from effective talent management, these initiatives also provide an excellent opportunity to foster tolerance and acceptance of people from different backgrounds. Furthermore, giving priority to management and leadership training ensures that line managers can effectively lead their teams. This is why talent management should be seen as a vital tool to ensure the maximum efficiency of any business and its employees’ talents.The challenge lies in the fact that companies can compromise the needs of various generations, each of whom has different priorities, goals, and motivations. Managing the expectations of these different groups is critical, as a one-size-fits-all approach will no longer attract and retain talent.Your generational cheat sheetAlthough statistics and behavioural guidelines are useful, it is important that HR professionals don’t stereotype individuals based on their age or their generation. While the classification of generations is beneficial when dealing with certain situations, such as age gap, it by no means represents all individuals who fall within a select age group. With this in mind, I recommend that the first step is to align the business strategy with the people strategy to determine the overall talent strategy for the company by setting up a plan that outlines the values and expectations of each generation that is present in the company – a generational cheat sheet of sorts. Needs and preferences vary, but taking the time to understand what employees really want will be an investment in developing future leaders. Bridging the gap between interpersonal communication and technology is also important – two areas that can create barriers between employees of different generations. Furthermore, creating a culture where employees feel more connected and invested in their employer and hosting cost-efficient, in-house programmes to train and deploy talent without loss of time is imperative.Diversity mattersManaging these challenges in an environment where revenues are under continuous scrutiny and companies are expected to identify a more cost-efficient model of working is a balancing act. Therefore, talent management needs to be a business strategy that enables companies to attract good talent and retain their top talented employees.There is good reason to do this. Helen Brown confirms this in her article, titled Trading Places: What brands can do to promote equality and diversity. In her words: “Beyond the desire to simply ‘do the right things’, there are sound commercial reasons for equality and diversity in the workplace. In the McKinsey report ‘Why Diversity Matters’, they stated companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were 33 percent more likely to have financial returns above their competitors, and those in the top quartile for gender diversity were 21 percent more likely to have increased financial returns.”To achieve this, I recommend four strategies that will assist in getting the most from the full generational range of employees:Training on communication and technology: Interpersonal communication and technology are two areas that can create barriers between employees of different generations – bridge this gap, because it will be worth it!Be transparent about goals in order to help employees feel valued: Create a culture where employees feel more connected and invested in their employer, no matter their life-stage.Provide growth and development opportunities: Stretch their skills, transfer their knowledge and help them feel valued at all times.Offer a wide variety of benefits: Needs and preferences vary, but take the time to understand what employees really want – it will be an investment in developing future leaders.Remember, as an HR professional, it is your responsibility to spearhead the company’s systems and structures to ensure there is a comprehensive understanding of the workforce and the different talent it employs. I’m fortunate to work at a company whose motto is to put people first, but if you are not, sell your company’s management team on talent management by focusing on the business benefits it will bring.About MediaComFor more information, visit www.mediacom.comFind us on Twitter @mediacomglobalLike us on Facebook at facebook.com/MediaComGlobalNews Join us on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/company/mediacom
