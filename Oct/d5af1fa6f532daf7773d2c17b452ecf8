Because if that fails on the day, it won’t matter what you decide to do with your marketing campaign. Track Your ResultsBefore you compile your campaigns, plan how you’ll track their success. This will inform future campaigns and determine your ROI. Know the BasicsWhen you get started on your BFCM campaign, make sure you have a strong grasp of the basics of email and inbound marketing. Offer Great DealsYour clients will be bombarded with multiple sales and big BFCM deals. Make sure yours stand out by offering something that your clients can’t resist. Tailor Your OfferNot every retailer has the margin to offer the kind of BFCM discounts you’ll see at giant retail organisations. But that doesn’t mean you should stay out of the game. Create UrgencyOne of the biggest conversion tactics employed during BFCM sales is the sense of urgency – they’ll never get products like this at these prices again. Use Hot Subject LinesOne of your audience’s first interactions with your sale will be through an email subject line – the make-or-break first impression of your campaign.
