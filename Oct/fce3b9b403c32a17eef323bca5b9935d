All toys donated will be distributed to underprivileged children at government hospitals, children’s homes and orphanages across KwaZulu-Natal. In a Toy Story first, to make a profound and ongoing change to the lives of little ones, East Coast Radio Toy Story with Toys R Us and Babies R Us will also identify four schools around KZN for upliftment. All monies collected during the campaign will be directed to address the needs at the four identified schools. East Coast Radio’s General Manager, Boni Mchunu, says she believes that Toy Story can make a lasting impact on our country’s future through investing in education: “Our outreach efforts will take the form of seeing what each particular school’s need is greatest. From infrastructure to educational resources; fundraising will be focused on the area we believe will have the most sustainable impact. We envision the initiative playing a defining role in empowering and equipping young minds.” Nicole Jansen Van Vuuren, Toys R Us and Babies R Us Marketing Manager, adds, “Toys R Us and Babies R Us is so proud to be part of such an incredible campaign and apart from being able to give toys to those less fortunate and to add joy to their festive season, we are thrilled with the focussed drive on selected schools to ensure there is a noticeable impact made.” <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465494-625x416.jpg" alt="Mohammed Khatib, Mo Magic, Bongani Mtolo, Boni Mchunu, Carvin Goldstone and Tyrone Pillay with Geoffrey the Giraffe from Toys R Us.
