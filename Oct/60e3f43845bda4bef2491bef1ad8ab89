Youth culture is slightly different to how we have previously defined culture because technology and digital media have ensured that culture is no longer as restricted by geographical boundaries. The Internet has ensured that a trend, topic or dance move can become a global cultural phenomenon in a matter of hours. For brands, this means that solely looking at what your competitor is doing is no longer enough. Locating your brand in culture is now the key strategic pillar to winning with youth. Simple as it sounds, this is an exercise that requires authenticity, consistency and the ability to listen – things that only a few brands seem to have been able to get right.Heritage Month has just come to an end and most brands that were plastering their social media pages with African prints will abruptly stop and go back to business as usual…until the next celebration. The short-term goals may have been met in terms of engagement but with time, the returns will get lower and eventually the identity of your brand blurred by the effects of jumping on every bandwagon. Inkomazi got it brilliantly right when they collaborated with Sjava. It’s an authentic and believable fit.Albany and Tastic also collaborated with Esther Mahlangu in creating Heritage Day inspired packaging. The campaign has garnered attention, but the real test will be in whether there is sustainability. Are these brands really who they say are in September? Or is it a gimmick that will be dusted off a year later? That is where brands still have strides to make.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/460973-625x366.png" alt="Dr Ester Mahlangu" width="625" height="366">Dr Ester Mahlanguhttps://citybuzz.co.za/88602/dr-esther-mahlangu-hosts-art-masterclass-national-school-arts-nsa-braamfontein/The youth market is a tribe and like all other tribes in the world, there is a code, a way of living that is deemed acceptable by them. Nike understands this, and the brand consistently communicates that, making their presence in the youth tribe palpable. Nike’s messaging also appeals to other tribes, those that also believe in equality, those who believe in winning and those who believe in second chances among other things. The tribes that don’t subscribe to that now know that Nike is not for them and they’ve been burning Nike sneakers, distancing themselves from the brand. That has pushed the tribes that resonate with Nike to boost sales by 31% after the Colin Kaepernick advert. Where Nike also shines is in doing this consistently.With the youth being the consumer of the present and the future, now is the time to get them to buy into your brand. If they don’t believe you now, trying to convince them to spend their hard-earned rands a decade down the line will put you behind the curve. It isn’t just politicians that have to be on the right side of history, brands and businesses too. Your bottom line and the trust of #TheNext, depends on it.
