We now live in an always-on, hyper-connected digital world and this presents a new realm of both opportunities and challenges for marketers. Many are still figuring it out, but these six creative agencies have cracked the code. Drawn from their winning performance in the IAB’s Bookmarks awards for digital excellence, the six agency heavyweights are Ogilvy, King James, M&C Saatchi Abel, Net#work BBDO, HelloComputer and VML. These creative powerhouses were more awarded in digital than the rest of the industry combined and the Red & Yellow Digital Agency Showcase gives eager minds the opportunity to learn about their formula for success. And it’s free! The need to learn and grow is immense, but conventional conferences come with high ticket prices, making it impossible for smaller companies and start-ups to attend. In line with their conviction that relentless curiosity and lifelong learning is the bedrock of great careers, Red & Yellow wanted to provide a more accessible learning opportunity. A free conference that showcases SA’s top six digital agencies, aligned to their positioning in the market as digital marketing educational specialists. The proof-points supporting this claim are: their eMarketing textbook, used by academic institutions around the world; as well as their flagship Digital Marketing online course and post-grad qualification - Advanced Diploma in Digital Marketing. The day promises to be interesting and informative, with the final highlight being post-conference conversations and catch-ups while enjoying sunset drinks at Red & Yellow’s spectacular rooftop bar. Fortunately for those that missed the opportunity to get a ticket for the event, it will be live-streamed for free on Red & Yellow’s Facebook page - www.facebook.com/redandyellowed. So don’t miss out!
