We will initially place them in our weekend training slot from 3-6am, but I am sure they will soon work their way up!”Minnie says she has to pinch herself everyday just to make sure it’s not a dream, “Our lives are about to change, I’m so excited about the growth that lies ahead. A lot of people have contributed to where my career is now and their support is truly heartfelt. Don’t ever forget that your dreams are valid.” Tee adds, “I’m super excited to start this new chapter in my life. This is the type of thing you dream about when you’re kid and to see it manifest is honestly amazing.”The two will take over from well-loved Durban comedian and ECR presenter Neil Green, who moves to daytime to host Sundays 2pm-6pm. He replaces Lubz who leaves the station end-September.Neil is a natural storyteller and a star on the KZN comedy scene and Derbyshire believes having him on Old Skool Sundays is an obvious move.Neil says, “I'm thrilled to be moving to Old Skool Sundays. Sunday Afternoons have always been my favourite, I'm just glad I get to share them with East Coast Listeners now. So break out the peach slices and dessert cream and come get comfortable and nostalgic with me.”
