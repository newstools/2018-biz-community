This specific recognition is made even more special as it’s granted by former laureates of the award, and thus bestowed on a title just once.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459558.jpg" alt="New Media publication (VISI) wins global design award" width="120" height="120">New Media publication (VISI) wins global design awardAhead of its much-anticipated 100th issue in early 2019, New Media-owned décor, design and architecture brand VISI has been awarded the A'Design Award for Best Design Media...Issued by New Media 21 Sep 2018<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1710/414456.jpg" alt="New Media wins gold in New York" width="120" height="120">New Media wins gold in New YorkNew Media was awarded gold for VISI, the agency's own design and décor title, at the prestigious Folio's 2017 Eddie & Ozzie Awards Luncheon in New York City on Wednesday...Issued by New Media 13 Oct 2017I chatted to Brink, also a judge at the recent 100% Design Awards and adjudicator for the 2018 Corobrik SAIA Architectural Awards, about the impact of this iconic design award, as well as the magazine’s staying power with readers.

What does this level of appreciation for your work mean to you and the team? It means the world to us! First and foremost, it’s a team effort and not only the work of one individual.

Explain the magazine’s content mandate. Visi has always been about beautiful images supported by great writing and excellent design. We have incredibly high production values, and we will go all the way to capture something spectacular. While we do look to the world for inspiration, our focus is on Africa. We’re fortunate that people want to know about African design more than ever, and that we’re in the perfect position to inform the world..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Fantastic. You’re also celebrating your 100th issue soon – talk us through a few of the magazine’s highlights over the years. There have been too many highlights over the past 20 years to mention! It’s amazing to know that every issue of Visi is a collector’s edition for so many people, but with our 100th we’re raising the bar even higher.

Without giving away too much: In addition to a bumper volume, there will be 100 limited editions filled with exclusive surprises. This is one not to be missed! .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}We’ll keep our eyes peeled for it! Talk us through the design principles Visi stands for and how those have changed over the years. Over the years, the title has seen a number of art directors and a few different editors and each one has put his or her stamp on it, but to this day there is still a Visi look that one can easily identify: Beautiful first, of course, but also unexpected and a little bit crazy!

Either way, it’s the two extremes that make Visi emotive and unforgettable. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}An interesting approach. How do you bring those design principles through in the magazine, as well as online? While we are aware that there are overlaps, these are also two different audiences, and we cater for them both. In fact, we have the best of both worlds: Online, we can report on something newsy immediately and we can offer the exclusive, keepsake luxury of appearing in a print magazine. It’s a different experience to lean-back and luxuriate in our print product verses the instant gratification of the digital dive, and we make sure that when you land on the Visi site or Instagram feed, there’s engaging daily content that’s as beautiful as you see in print and that provides you with your design fix.

Clearly, it’s not, with Visi’s impressive ABC circulation figures as proof. Explain the importance of print in a largely digital age. Despite the challenging global and local economy, Visi has remained uncompromising on delivering a world-class print product. By consistently delivering on our architecture, decor and design pillars, and our promise of being 'SA’s most beautiful magazine', we remain relevant to those in the industry and those simply looking for escapism and inspiration.
