Supported by a digital campaign and radio promotion “Don’t be chicken, check them” will run throughout October in Eastern Cape Spars. “There’s value in goodness, and that’s what Sovereign Foods is all about,” remarks Gerald Walter, Marketing Director at Sovereign Foods. “We aim to care, make a difference and make a real impact on people, lives and business; and this is one way for us to give back.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/464097.png" alt="&amp;quot;Don't be chicken, check 'em&amp;quot;" width="280" height="400"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/464099.png" alt="&amp;quot;Don't be chicken, check 'em&amp;quot;" width="228" height="400">
