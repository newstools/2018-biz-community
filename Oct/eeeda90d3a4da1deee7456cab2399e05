The ECR team have done an incredible job of making Toy Story a much anticipated and well known campaign for the year! The main aim of the campaign is to pull our community together to give back and to ensure we add joy to the lives of those in need! In our dealings with local organisations, we have seen first-hand that a toy is not just an  object, but is a symbol of excitement, joy and a bit of hope, which every child deserves to feel.”East Coast Radio’s Boni Mchunu says the station is delighted to have Toys R Us/Babies R Us on board, “East Coast Radio’s Toy Story reminds us that we all have an important duty to play in ensuring the well-being of disadvantaged children in our country. We are honoured to facilitate giving on such a massive scale and are so grateful to our sponsors for all their efforts in making this possible.”Other key sponsors that have come on board this year include; Durban Deliveries, who will facilitate the collection of toys from stores, schools and businesses; Gift of the Givers Foundation who assist with storing and then packing toys for distribution; Hirt and Carter, who manufacture the Toy Story boxes; Verigreen who manufacture bags for the campaign and Red Cross Air Mercy Services, who assist with the distribution of toys to rural areas.When the campaign officially rolls out from 22 October, KwaZulu-Natalians will be able to donate a toy at any Toys R Us & Babies R Us store across the province. Last year, KZN listeners, schools and businesses donated 20,000 new toys and more than R750,000 towards East Coast Radio’s Toy Story campaign.
