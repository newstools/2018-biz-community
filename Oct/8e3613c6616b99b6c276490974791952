The annual summit brings some of the world’s most innovative minds together to address humanity’s greatest needs and challenges for the future, and explore how emerging technologies can meet them. In keeping with the innovative spirit of the event and the overarching theme, #FutureProofAfrica, Liberty wanted to do something truly memorable and thought-provoking. Developed in partnership with TBWA Hunt Lascaris, the Liberty Apartment of the Future was born. Based on current insights and predictions around the future of Africa, a futuristic micro-apartment was constructed, designed to give summit delegates a taste of what life might be like in 2035. Why a micro-apartment? By 2035, approximately 80% of Africans will be living in cities. This rapid increase in urbanisation makes the concept of the micro-apartment an extremely viable housing solution, and an ideal vehicle for Liberty to give delegates a glimpse into the future while positioning the brand as a forward-thinking partner for every moment of their clients’ journey. Only 15 square metres in size, the surprisingly comfortable living space features a breathing exterior, a multi-functional eating/living space and a self-sustaining, food-producing hydroponic vertical garden. This indoor eco-system represents the concept of urban farming, which would make it possible to grow food for a growing population in spaces where conditions are unfavourable. Designed and constructed by Library Special Projects, every single element in the Liberty Apartment of the Future was carefully considered and curated based on extensive research. Visitors were encouraged to touch, play and explore – each of the plants in the space played a specific sound when touched, and lighting changed to represent different times of the day. Thanks to this approach, we  offered SingularityU SA Summit delegates an immersive, standout experience as opposed to the average, run-of-the-mill exhibition stands normally seen at conventions.
