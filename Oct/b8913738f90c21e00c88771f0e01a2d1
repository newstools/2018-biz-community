"Our goal when we launched the Amasa Awards in 2014 was to show how much value agencies can add to client’s businesses and this new award promises to do just that.” The most-entered categories for 2018 include: Best Tactical use of Media, Best use of Mobile and Best use of Technology and Data. Longstanding Amasa committee member and judge Wayne Bischoff had this to say: “There is still a large gap between the entries that won Gold and the majority, and that gap needs to be filled. Amasa will endeavour to give feedback in an open session on what is missing and how to level up. There was definitely uncertainty in what ‘insight-based’ media strategy meant and many of the ‘insights’ that should inform the strategy were just facts. A fact without the insight it points to is useless. "These awards are vital part of our industry make-up. They celebrate passion and excellence in media strategy and creative innovation. They also help increase the understanding of the importance of excellent media planning and strategy in delivering on client’s business and marketing objectives. In addition, by celebrating the agencies and individuals who win Golds and the Grand Prix, we increase the professionalism of the industry and hopefully attract and retain future stars.” The shortlisted agencies are: .kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px solid red; font-size:12px;}Best Branded ContentOMDStandard Bank Your Next MillionMediamarkFoshini Sebenza GirlHitch DigitalER 24 Festive SeasonOgilvyHuggies Kids Marathon CampaignBest Contribution by a Media OwnerTiso Black StarNando's #RightmynameAd ColonyDebonairs Pizza South Africa - Smoking BBQAdReachEntry Name : Beyond the RiverMediamarkFoshini Sebenza GirlBest Experiential/EventOgilvyCarling Black Label - Soccer Song for ChangePlaymakersTwo Icons TourJC DeceauxSurvivorThe MediaShopThe Eastgate Extra Time ChallengeBest Integrated: FinancialVizeumSanlam 2 Minute Shower SongStandard BankStandard Bank Your Next MillionStandard BankStandard Bank Joy of JazzPrimedia BroadcastingStandard Bank - African ConnectedBest Integrated: FMCGOgilvyCarling Black Label - No ExcusesOgilvyHuggies Kids Marathon CampaignPhdAquafresh - #KeepitFresh MafikizoloPhdLiquifruit - Summer AnthemCaratEdward Snell - Russian Bear VodkaBest Integrated: MediaJC DeceauxSurvivorBest Integrated: RetailThe MediaShopNando's #rightmynameThe MediaShopThe Eastgate Extra Time ChallengeOMDEDCON Retail (Incl ecommerce & QSR): Offline Measurement & SearchBest Integrated: Other Consumer GoodsLevergyNew Balance #BeProteasBest Integrated: Public ServicesThe MediaShopImperial Road Safety - Safe Scholar ProgrammeBest Integrated: TransportHitch DigitalHarley Davidson Project RevolutionLevergyIDQ Fast TrackMediacomShell – LGBTIThe MediaShopImperial Road Safety - Safe Scholar ProgrammeBest Integrated: Travel, Entertainment & LeisureThe MediaShopSouth African Tourism (SAT)Best Integrated: B2BDemographicaNedbank Seat At the TableBest OnlineThe MediaShopDebonairs Pizza - ChristopherOgilvyHuggies Kids Marathon CampaignThe Media ImageA Havaianas SummerThe MediaShopCell CZenithDettolMindshareAware.orgBest Social MediaThe MediaShopDebonairs Pizza - ChristopherBrand TruthFNB Budget SpeechLevergyNew Balance #BeProteasIndaHASHCarling Black Label - Song of Change #NoExcuseZenithDettolJust PalmMiller Genuine DraftBest Pro Bono/Cause RelatedAdReachBeyond the RiverHavasUnicef Father's DayBest SponsorshipLevergyNew Balance #BeProteasLevergyAudi Q5 Fast TrackPlaymakers#CokeScoreChallengeBest Trade MarketingMediamarkMediamark Black FridayAds24Ads24 presents Food for Thought 2018Ads24Ads24 Wat Meme JyBest Use of a Small BudgetMediacomRoycoPhdVW Date My FamilyOMDEDCON Clinique Online Supported Instore Promo CampaignBest Use of MobileMindshareLucozadeThe Media ImageA Havaianas SummerAd ColonySamsung S9MediacomUber Eats M&MsJust PalmOmo Gentle HandsBest Use of TechnologyThe MediaShopDebonairs Pizza - ChristopherThe MediaShopCell COgilvyHuggies Kids Marathon CampaignThe Media ImageA Havaianas SummerAd ColonyHeineken South Africa - Uefa Champions LeaguePoster ScopeLiveposterBest Tactical Use of MediaOgilvyCarling Black Label - Soccer Song for ChangeThe MediaShopCell CThe MediaShop#It-Can-WaitThe MediaShopNando's #rightmynameThe MediaShopDebonairs Pizza - ChristopherRed StarSoweto GoldMediaComRoycoTickets are selling fast for the Gala Awards dinner on 10 October at the Hilton Hotel in Sandton.
