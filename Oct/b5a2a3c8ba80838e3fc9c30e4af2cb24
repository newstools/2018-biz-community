This might not be typical business dialogue, but these and similar exclamations were par for the course at the Cape Town version of Ads24's Food For Thought event...By Leigh Andrews 1 day agoPost ‘gastronomic adventure’ at the Ads24 Food for thought summit, dialogue director Prof Nick Binedell introduced one of the day's key speakers, master scenario planner Clem Sunter.Sunter explained how to look at the future based on a talk he calls ‘growing foxes’, with insights into the global economy as we reach the tail-end of 2018, as well as possible scenarios for SA.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/462981.jpg" alt="The benefits of being a 'business fox' when scenario planning" width="625" height="470">© Jahoo via 123 RF.comHighlighting the difference between single-minded hedgehogs, and foxes, for whom multiple future scenarios are possible, Sunter said it is better to be vaguely right than it is to be precisely wrong.A hedgehog sees one single future and makes all his plans around that, rejects all other futures and just goes for it. This is a very 'high stakes' strategy because if you get the future wrong, you lose everything. Foxes, on the other hand, have very bright eyes to pick up changes on in the environment, with the agility to get out of trouble quickly and pounce on opportunities.Sunter says businesses need to be agile like foxes, in order to respond in the best possible way as the point of a flag is to watch it 24/7 for any change.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1805/442426-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Dawie Roodt, economist and political analyst." width="120" height="120">Ads24 provides Food for Thought for the road to 2019Ads24s hosted its second Food for Thought at Hyde Park recently, featuring academic, Prof Nick Binedell, economist and political analyst Dawie Roodt and management strategist and scenario planner Clem Sunter...29 May 2018He then shared two interesting examples on the power of asking for red flags in scenario planning. The first was of asking females what they consider as flags before committing to a potential partner. Top of the list of responses was ‘the parents’ - they picture what their partner will be like in 25 years’ time, based on the example their partner's parents are setting.Top international red flags to watchSecond, and much more serious, was based on a session with Interpol. At the top of their list of flags for 2010 to 2020 was migration as a result of porous borders between countries, closely followed by cyber-terrorism.Sunter then shared an overview of the top international red flags to watch, which he has shared in previous sessions. Key among these is still the big red flag of religious extremism, as well as the anti-establishment revolutionary mindset, the ‘grey flag’ of the ageing global population and the ‘green flag’ of climate change awareness. Of the last one, Sunter said:We need to have a serious conversation about what we are doing to heal the planet, as serious climate change will happen this century and will affect our children.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1610/364599-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Clem Sunter chats to host, Bruce Whitfield at the Deloitte State of the Nation forum.

We also need continued pockets of excellence – while South African shopping malls and education tend to be seen as excellent, you need to have money to access these. We need to find ways of replicating the virtue of our good schools without dumbing them down. Another important flag to consider here is that of entrepreneurial spark. Gone are the days where business created jobs, of waving your CV around and securing a job. Nowadays, the rise of automation and AI means most of us need to create a job rather than get a job, and the skills to do so are different. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/456480-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image © Prazis via ." width="120" height="120">#YouthReport2018: Generation jobless and the high inequality economyExplaining concepts like the 'missing middle' and various African economic myths and misconceptions, Professor Haroon Bhorat shared the harsh economic realities of growing up in South Africa today, at the launch of the UCT Unilever Institute of Strategic Marketing's Youth Report 2018...By Leigh Andrews 7 Sep 2018The younger generation faces a much bigger challenge here than their parents did.

Teach kids to live in this world and the world that’s coming.Binedell said, “Debate done and dusted, what will you do tomorrow? We need activists, we need action.”Sunter concluded with the words that foxes challenge assumptions by also offering alternatives.
