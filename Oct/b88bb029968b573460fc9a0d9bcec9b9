The winners were announced in Sandton this week on Wednesday night (10 October). Ogilvy SA CCO Pete Case says he’s delighted to see these two highly innovative pieces of work get further recognition: “We believe that our role as an agency is not only to create compelling stories and experiences that connect with consumers, but also to unlock the power of modern media to gain maximum consumer attention. Both of these campaigns do exactly that, using digital media to create impressive earned attention and consumer impact for the brands involved.” Huggies Baby Marathon – which won a 2018 Grand Prix Loerie for Ogilvy Johannesburg earlier in the year – is an online data-driven campaign using specially created technology to track how far four different South African babies crawled in their Huggies nappies over a seven-day period. Recording their efforts in an emotive and highly engaging way, through the world’s first ‘Baby Marathon’. With its targeted online media approach, the campaign recorded a direct lift in Huggies sales of 28.9% and an ROI of 29 to 1. Carling Black Labels ‘Soccer Song For Change’ won a Cannes Grand Prix this year for Ogilvy Cape Town and is part of the brand’s wider #NoExcuse campaign against gender violence. The activation involved a female choir singing a football anthem at the Soweto derby with the lyrics hijacked halfway through, to tell the story of women potentially being abused by their partners when they come home under the influence of alcohol from a game which their team has lost. The new words bought high levels of emotion and impact to the capacity crowd at the FNB Soccer Stadium and the choir’s performance was televised live, with commentators primed to explain the meaning behind this unique intervention to their millions of viewers. The activation created a larger audience than the 2010 world cup opening game and went on to amass an earned media value of over 31.8 million Rands for the brand.
