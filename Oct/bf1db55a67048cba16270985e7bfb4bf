Beautiful News shared the stories of people who have been diagnosed with, and are affected by breast cancer, this Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Each of their journeys highlighted the importance of early detection, and showed that support is available every step of the way. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/464581.jpg" alt="Together, South Africans are beating breast cancer" width="420" height="73">When Merlin Osborne was diagnosed, she believed nothing could prepare her for what she was about to experience. But then she found support on water, joining Africa’s first breast cancer survivor dragon boating team. After Jade Wyngaardt found a lump in her breast, she also discovered she was pregnant with twins. She braved cancer treatment throughout her pregnancy, as well as a mastectomy that left her with one breast to feed two children. Today, her kids are happy and healthy. To reduce the waiting time for patients in need of a mastectomy, Dr Liana Roodt assembled a crew of surgeons and nurses who work overtime to offer free, life-saving surgery to people with breast cancer. Tamar Thorn is a tattoo artist helping mastectomy patients regain control and pride of their body by inking nipple tattoos for free. And for those who have reconstructive surgery, Nneile Nkholise is using 3D printing to drastically reduce the cost of breast implants. On National Mammography Day, we urge people to have breast cancer screenings as early as possible. Whatever the outcome, we are surrounded by people who have walked this path before. South Africans are filled with the strength to keep fighting, and the resourcefulness, courage, and empathy to support those affected by breast cancer.
