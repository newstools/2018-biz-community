With a theme of "magic and logic" Bongani and Mags were tasked with keeping the audience engaged while presenting the various categories. The East Coast Drive presenters who have only been on radio together for a year, but have already been recognised through various awards and opportunities, say they were honoured to be part the Amasa Awards. Bongani Mtolo says it was great to be involved, “It is refreshing to see people being recognised for the amazing work that they do. People in advertising are very similar to people in radio, so it was also great to actually speak to people who understand your business.” Mags Westerhof adds, “For Bongani and I to be chosen to present the awards to all the talent that we hear on radio and that we see on television, to be the person that presents those awards and be present has been amazing.”
