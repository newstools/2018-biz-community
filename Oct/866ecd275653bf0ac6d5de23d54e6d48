But it's a mammoth task to undertake if you don't know where to begin. To help with this, HeForShe unveiled three specific solutions to achieve gender equality around the world:The HeForShe Proven Solutions Report, on how to achieve parity in global leadership – based on the roadmap set out by PwC Network, which moved from 18% female global leadership representation to 47% in 15 months.The HeForShe Emerging Solutions for Gender Equality Report, offering 34 concrete emerging solutions for closing the gender pay gap, ending gender-based and sexual violence, and achieving parity across society.HeForShe also unveiled its first Male Allies Guide for Gender Equality, based on a programme pioneered by Finland’s government to enlist army conscripts and prevent violence against women.And then, of course, there’s the fact that SA’s own former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka is now the visionary leader of UN Women, the UN entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. SA's involvement and broader continental impactA global champion for women and girls, UN Women was established to accelerate progress on meeting their needs worldwide.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/444022-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertising" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertisingThe Unstereotype Alliance launched at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity last year and has just joined Twitter...By Leigh Andrews 11 Jun 2018THE GAMBIA <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/428194-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Jaha Dukureh named UN Women regional goodwill ambassador for Africa" width="120" height="120">Jaha Dukureh named UN Women regional goodwill ambassador for AfricaUN Women has named renowned activist Jaha Dukureh of The Gambia as a regional goodwill ambassador for the organisation...6 Feb 2018Now, SA has a stronger voice on the platform, with IOL confirming Standard Bank group chief executive Sim Tshabalala as a thematic champion for gender equality.Tshabalala joins the likes of Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada and Dr Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group, as fellow thematic champions, dedicated supporters of gender equality and women’s empowerment, serving as public champions for change.More than just ambassadors, they’re putting action first and foremost in implementing game-changing policies and concrete actions towards gender parity.GLOBAL<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/428577-120x120.jpg?2" alt="One of many #Peoplekind memes that sprang up across the web.

Women embody half the world’s talent, skill and energy – and more than half of its purchasing power. So every sensible business leader must be committed to achieving gender equity in their company and to contributing to gender equity in the societies in which we operate.The good news? Progress is being made, slowly but surely. While Standard Bank confirms that Namibia and South Africa both score in the Top 20 in the WEF global report on gender equality, after closing 78% to 76% of their gender gaps, but sub-Saharan Africa still displays a wider range of gender gap outcomes than practically any other region.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/459576-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Females, here's how to future-proof your career..." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Females, here's how to future-proof your career...In light of the annual WEF Gender Gap Report, Ayanda Seboni, group executive of brand, marketing and communications at PPS, shares ways for females to stay relevant and effectively future-proof their careers...By Leigh Andrews 24 Sep 2018Looking at how other countries fare, in the first week, at least one man in every single country of the world had made the #HeForShe commitment.
