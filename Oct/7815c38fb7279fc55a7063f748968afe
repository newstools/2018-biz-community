For Just Design Jhb, the reaction to animals is much the same, and this passion was very much a driving factor in the Marltons brand and packaging upgrade. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/463208.jpg" alt="Too much of cute for Marltons" width="500" height="202">Whilst Marltons has been around since 1945, it has amassed very little brand equity or brand love. Their range of products, although comprehensive, also didn’t spur much excitement amongst pet lovers. The Jhb team relooked the brand, its visual language, messaging and its packaging. A bold, new modern look was implemented, with a big dose of personality. Marltons now owns royal blue and cannot be missed on shelf. Add to that a quirky photographic style, adorable animals plus a bit of humour, and you have the makings of a real category leader!<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/463209.jpg" alt="Too much of cute for Marltons" width="500" height="352">Look out for the new look Marltons on shelf – but especially the Snacks and Treats range. The begging pug, pleading lab and mischievous husky – cuteness overload!Want to read about insights, trends and other cool stuff? Sign up to our mailing list.
