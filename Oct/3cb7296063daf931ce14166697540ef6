The walk was led by Eastern Cape MECs Ms Helen Sauls-August (Health), Pumza Dyantyi (Social Development) and Nelson Mandela Bay executive mayor Mongameli Bobani, as well as contingent of Isuzu Southern Kings players.It took nearly an hour for the back markers to walk past the start line – while some of the faster walkers were already arriving back at The Boardwalk. Helen Sauls-August, Eastern Cape MEC of Health, fired off the starter’s pistol for the more than 13,300 walkers."As the department of health, we are seeing an increase in the incidence of cancer. Too many people are diagnosed late. "Our support of the Big Walk for Cancer is to encourage people to be tested early.""The department is focusing on getting the message to men that they need to be tested regularly and from a young age for cancer," she said "Eighty to 90% of the people coming to our clinics are women and children. We want to see more men at the clinics."As the MEC of health my appeal to the people of the Eastern Cape is to change their lifestyle by eating healthy, exercising – and getting tested," she said."This is the fourth year that Algoa FM has partnered with the Eastern Cape Department of Health in an awareness programme which starts weeks ahead of the Big Walk with free clinics hosted around the province," says Algoa FM managing director Dave Tiltmann.  “The vibe at the Sun Boardwalk today was just incredible. It is always a wake-up call to see how many people have been affected by cancer, either personally or through family and friends,” added Algoa FM operations director Alfie Jay.The beneficiaries of the 2018 Algoa FM Big Walk for Cancer presented by the Eastern Cape Department of Health is CANSA (the Cancer Association of South Africa).
