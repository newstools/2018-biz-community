<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/463635.jpg" alt="Everlytic launches new marketing automation feature: Workflows" width="140" height="120">Until now, drip campaigns have been the best-in-class when it comes to sending relevant content to readers. This is because they deliver pre-written messages at customisable intervals, triggered by things like subscription events, birthdays, anniversaries, and once-off start dates. A direct-marketing strategy like this is often used in lead nurturing campaigns, leading subscribers through the sales funnel, or to specific end goals. Workflows, on the other hand, offer the benefits of drip campaigns, plus so much more. Like drip campaigns, workflows allow messages to go out at specific times and with strategic delays. But when combined with conditional triggers and smart database management, workflows can also send messages based on conditions like behaviour, location, or personal information; effectively adapting the email / SMS journey for different audiences. Workflows save time, resources, and can increase sales with targeted messaging. The technology’s dynamic and customisable nature also means that workflows can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including:  Nurturing new leads  Onboarding new customers  Engaging with and upselling to existing customers  Educational campaigns The major benefit of using a workflow is that once it’s set up, it’s automatic. Users will move from one node to the next according to the parameters and triggers a company sets up, keeping your leads and subscribers engaged while marketers focus on other business tasks. Being highly personalised and automated, this also means that businesses can deliver relevant content when their readers need it, with less risk for error. Once a workflow is active, businesses can view reports on how subscribers interact with it. This shows the actions, messages, and queued contacts in a workflow, as well as the delays between actions, and how many contacts each message has been sent to. On a micro level, one can also access workflow node reports. These give detailed information about specific nodes as well as an individual contact’s journey through every node in the workflow. Reporting like this allows businesses to find and analyse areas for improvement so they can tweak their workflows to meet their objectives. In today’s business-to-human marketing landscape, creating meaningful connections with subscribers is critical. Workflows simplify the process end-to-end, enabling businesses to take clients on personalised, relevant, and perfectly timed journeys automatically.
