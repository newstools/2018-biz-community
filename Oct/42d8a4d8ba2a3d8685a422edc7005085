The event kicked off at 3pm with teams divided in groups from local industry creative, designers from spree.co.za, RLabs, Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography, Cape Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology, and other organisations. Jam-goers got the chance to learn from the best in the industry and speakers included the founder of R Labs and Jim Taylor speaking directly from the USA live via Adobe as well as the latest Adobe XD Tutorial given by Carla Ralph from Adobe South Africa.  Teams of handpicked industry designers along with Stellenbosch Academy students squared off in a mobile app development challenge with a social impact theme announced just hours earlier. The Adobe representatives from the USA judged the final ideas that had to be conceptualised and created within two hours. Stellenbosch Academy students, Jonathan De Goede, Sarchen Gainsford and lecturer – Keenan Jooste – showed off their skills, competing against eight other teams made up of students, scholars, industry creatives and developers. They were placed first at the event, prototyping an app that helped the victim when reporting sexual abuse.  We would like to thank Spree’s team, Ryk and Esther for the invitation to the Creative Jam as well as Adobe USA and Adobe South Africa for this amazing opportunity.
