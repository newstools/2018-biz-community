Indeed, the Galliova Awards honour the overall promotion of South Africa’s local food culture, with health writers also recognised for their excellent balanced reporting on health and nutrition issues.MC Justine Drake, editor of Fresh Living, said she has attended all 29 years of the Galliova Awards and, in reminiscing, spoke of the changing media landscape. She first started work in the industry on an electric typewriter, with film in her camera, and smoking in her office. Nowadays, she said, “If you’re not on social media, you’re not really there.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1707/403138-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Alphaspirit © –" width="120" height="120">Can media workers ever really switch off from work?With each technological advancement, it becomes easier than ever to work from anywhere. But is that really the ideal we should be aiming for? And can we really reach ‘inbox zero'...By Leigh Andrews 25 Jul 2017Drake added that the future is looking bright in terms of awareness of the importance of eating well and wanting to know the farmers behind the food we eat. We are much more aware, which is a definite positive.This was followed by an address by Aziz Sulliman, current chairman of the SA Poultry Association, who said the last year was a tough one for the poultry industry but that he wants to encourage the use of proudly South African poultry products, as the situation has improved and has a beneficial impact on the economy.Local food legendsIllustrating the importance of knowing where your food comes from, he said while many lost their lives to the Listeriosis outbreak last year, when it came to local products, the strain could be traced back to not just the factory but even to the specific factory room and shift the outbreak stemmed form – we just can’t do the same with imported food.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/463999-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Listeriosis risk lingers in rural, informal trade" width="120" height="120">Listeriosis risk lingers in rural, informal tradeListeria bacteria remains present in food samples obtained from rural areas and the informal sector.

Drake applauded his extraordinary passion for the industry and love of food writers, mentioning that the egg and broiler boards are now joint sponsors of the Galliova Awards, so entries are welcomed for writing on both chicken and eggs.Oosthuizen showed a graph of how egg supply recovered from the impact of last year’s avian flu outbreak, and also spoke of the importance of buying local.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/464621.jpg" alt="Image: Author's own.

We’d worked up quite an appetite by this stage, so ate up the fresh farm bread served to each table, as well as delicious starters – we had a choice of the chicken mousse with croquettes, charred cos lettuce, Parmesan, tempura white anchovies, poached crumbed chicken egg, spinach and cos emulsion; or the vegetarian butternut ricotta tortellini with broth, honey, curried couchettes, Gorgonzola mousse and hazelnuts. Both were pronounced delicious, with plates scraped clean.This was followed by an address by Galliova judge Dorah Sitole, introduced by Drake with the words, “If there was ever a food icon, it’s Dorah, who has faced many challenges in her life and effectively changed the way people think of food in Africa.

A post shared by  Leigh Andrews (@ramblinglitchi123) on Oct 19, 2018 at 3:23am PDT Sitole began with the words that she’s inherently very shy, and spoke of the honour of attending and winning at the Galliova Awards.Especially when you’re starting out as a food writer or stylist, attending events like the Galliova Awards is the best thing you can do, as the magic dust of other creatives rubs off on you.Having judged the Galliova Awards for the past decade, Sitole shared that there’s always a robust discussion amongst judges over scores, so that whoever wins is truly worthy. Offering advice to next year’s entrants Sitole said to make sure the recipes published are easy to follow and easy to understand – ask yourself if the average reader understand the instruction: “Beat to a soft peak”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1710/416188-120x120.jpg?2" alt="From left to right: Marco Torsius (standing), Back: Esther Malan, Dorah Sitole, Marthinette Slabber Stretch, Glynnis Horning, Christa Swanepoel, Zola Nene.

She would like to see more authentic South African flavour reflected and reaching our readers.Poultry poetry narrativeThis was followed by a poetry narrative competition, where each table had five minutes to write a narrative of their own concoction, including the following words used in context: Bellybutton, drumstick, eish ek se, steam train, braai and poached egg.With some displaying impressive rapping skills, this was a super amusing interpretation and proved that even the food stylists among us have a way with words.
