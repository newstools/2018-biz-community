<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/464145-625x417.jpg" alt="ITU X G experiences" width="625" height="417">The World ITU Conference is an event which brings together global telecommunication leaders to exhibit and share learnings. With the event being hosted on the African continent for the first time, it was the perfect opportunity for Telkom to make a global impact. Expo and stand designExpos and trade shows are usually a visual shouting match. Each brand trying to outdo the other, often with very little to experience and enjoy when you get there. So rather than adding to the noise, Grid looked at a simple solution that valued guest experience over guest attention.The stand itself used the Telkom logo/device as the base for the design. The expand device (the logo holder with the plus symbol) complemented the idea of an expanded world which is enabled by Telkom. This single-minded idea became our creative platform for the stand. We then developed an overarching communication strategy of “Your World. Our Solutions.” This concept spoke to the fact that Telkom group, at every stage, has a solution for your world or problem - whether it be infrastructural, business or consumer related. This all came together in an integrated communication effort which began at the airport, moved through the streets of Durban and finally ended up at the Durban ICC itself.
