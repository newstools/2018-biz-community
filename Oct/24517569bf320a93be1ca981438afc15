Managing Director Renee Redelinghuys says, “Cape Town is globally recognised as one of the most beautiful cities in the world. As locals, we’re blessed with amazing summers, unprecedented scenery and a melting-pot of diverse cultures. Part of being Capetonian is celebrating our uniqueness and music festivals are just one of the ways we express ourselves. As Cape Town’s biggest station, we love providing the opportunity for our listeners to connect with old friends, make new ones, experiencing world-class live music at the iconic Cape Town venue, Newlands Stadium.” <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465698.jpg" alt="Heart Music Festival 2019 - More than just the music" width="280" height="187"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465699.jpg" alt="Heart Music Festival 2019 - More than just the music" width="282" height="187"><img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/465700.jpg" alt="Heart Music Festival 2019 - More than just the music" width="279" height="187">Festival Director Denver Apollus says, “Any festival organiser will tell you that music festivals take a massive amount of planning, hard work and big budgets. It’s a privilege to be able to say we are able to host this event independently and is officially recognised on the City of Cape Town’s official Events Calendar. We believe we have the most inclusive line-up of artists on one stage, which is a true reflection of Cape Town and its diverse demographic. This family-friendly event aims to appeal to both the young and young at heart, but most importantly creating an accessible, all-inclusive day for everyone to enjoy.” Tickets cost R150 per adult and R70 per child (under the age of 12). The 2019 Heart Cape Town Music Festival will see more than twenty top South African acts on one stage. For more information, go to www.heartfm.co.za/events/heart-cape-town-music-festival/.
