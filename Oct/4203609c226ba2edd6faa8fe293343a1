And, when going for upbeat and positivity as your motif, there can be a tendency to chuck clichés at your executions… like cute kids or animals.That’s what Absa appears to be doing in its latest ad for its Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) division.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1809/457960.jpg" alt="ATL campaign for Absa CIB enhances 'Africanacity'" width="120" height="120">ATL campaign for Absa CIB enhances 'Africanacity'The launch of 'I want to make that', Absa's new ATL campaign for Corporate and Investment Banking, is yielding strong results with its enhancement of Absa's new positioning of 'Africanacity'...Issued by Mortimer Harvey 13 Sep 2018One would have thought that hard-nosed investors or analysts would be capitivated by numbers and projections, not by ‘cutesy’. But clearly Absa doesn’t believe so, because the latest ad for the CIB business goes quite a way down the cliché route.We see a curious young girl, apparently fascinated by light and energy and capturing it – dreaming big. She imagines things that will help save the continent, Africa, which is her home.The voice-over speaks – in classic rose-tinted, hold-hands-and-sing-Kumbaya optimism – of what makes us here in Africa different from everyone else. This is the “bravery to imagine and the will to get things done”.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452223.png" alt="FCB Joburg distills essence of 'Africanacity' as it assists Absa relaunch in Africa" width="120" height="120">FCB Joburg distills essence of 'Africanacity' as it assists Absa relaunch in AfricaFCB Joburg has created a new word, as well as a 360° campaign embracing traditional and new media, to assist Absa Group, formerly Barclays Africa Group, in its relaunch in Africa...Issued by FCB Africa 7 Aug 2018That all adds up to Africanacity, Absa’s clever little word play which blends Africa and tenacity.The problem, though, is this: Look around you. Do you see much in the way of the will to get things done? In Eskom? In state-owned enterprises? In municipalities?Exactly.I am also not quite sure what the brand message is in there for the money crunchers, which will persuade them to entrust their money to the bank.However, if that all sounds like a build-up to handing out another Onion, let me disappoint you. Despite all the flaws and questions it poses, this ad has a simple charm, which is infectious. I think a lot of that has to do with exactly that positivity, something which has been in short supply in South Africa for a long time.There’s also an innocence about it all.But what saves the ad from middling is the superb production, the responsibility of director Dule of Chill Pill Films. The colours and the images throughout have a luminescent, almost dream-like quality. It’s like being caught up in a fairy tale.You watch it and wonder: Maybe, just maybe, the world could be like this one day…Orchids to Absa, the ad agency Mortimer Harvey, as well as production companies Casta Diva Pictures and Chill Pill Films.If you decide, as a brand, to go down the “mobile billboard” route and emblazon vehicles with your logos or your marketing messages, you need to be very, very careful. Some brand managers have told me over the years that they are reluctant to see their branding used in taxi advertising. That’s because there is a very real danger, given the way that many taxi drivers behave, that your company will end up being associated, however unwittingly, with criminal behaviour.However, when you are a collapsing and useless state-owned enterprise, you must be doubly careful that you don’t send out the ‘don’t-give-a-damn’ type messages to your customers.So I was infuriated to see a SA Post Office-branded car at the airport the other day, when I got back from Europe.To recap about this organisation: whereas Royal Mail in the UK promises that if you post a letter by 5pm, it will reach its destination anywhere in that country the next day, our equivalent’s actual performance ensures that, if you post a letter by June, it should get to the recipient by December. That is, if it is not opened to look for valuables to steal and then dumped in the nearest drain.I bet none of you reading this has recently received a car licence renewal reminder by post, which arrived ahead of time.So, guess what sort of car the SA Post Office (SAPO) chose to brand? A bakkie? No. A Toyota Corolla? No. All too utilitarian.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/448051-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mini Cooper S three-door" width="120" height="120">#TriedAndTested: New Mini Cooper and Mini Cooper SThe Mini Cooper has always been one of my secret favourites. Secret because, well, I didn't want to hurt my little trusty steed's feelings. But now that I've driven two of the new facelifted Mini Coopers, I am in a pickle... I want one!By Ilse van den Berg 9 Jul 2018This Sapo car was a Mini Cooper S, probably costing more than R300,000 when new and capable only of transporting driver and one passenger – at high speeds, naturally.It provides a great juxtaposition for your brand: fast car and abysmally slow service.An Onion for you. I won’t post it to you, because I doubt whether it would get there.
