Not only can we compose, arrange and re-record but we’re final mix aficionados for TVCs, radio spots, branded content in multiple languages and more. We have been the preferred audio supplier to Ministry Of Illusion for over 10 years. We also have our own extensive library music licence from Getty and can also assist in clearing music rights on any song. Original music and re-records, keeps us with our nose to the grindstone. Here are a few pieces we composed in the past few months. They’ve also picked up a couple of awards along the way!
