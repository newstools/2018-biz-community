Its members have made a tremendous contribution to realising AMASA’s vision; growing the organisation; improving educational and skills outcomes; and raising awareness of and support for the association’s work.” The incoming committee, he says, is made up of an excellent mix of agency, client and media owner professionals, including vibrant new blood that will bring fresh perspectives to the tasks in hand.  Over the past four years, the association has introduced the highly successful Amasa Awards; has revitalised, developed and expanded the Amasa Media Planning Workshops; has significantly developed the Amasa Golf Days; and has made the Amasa Annual Party an event to remember. All income from these events is used to fund bursaries for the Gordon Patterson Amasa Learnership Programme (ALP).  “The new committee aims to build on the successes of previous committees; maintain the incredible momentum in all of the association’s activities; grow the funding pool for the Gordon Patterson ALP ; and ensure that people who work in the industry or aspire to work in it have access to the very best education and skills training available,” he says.“I wish the members every success for their term in office and know they will make it a memorable one.”
