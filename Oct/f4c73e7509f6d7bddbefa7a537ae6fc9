It regularly reminds journalists to uphold the highest standards of ethics as prescribed in the Press Code, and to report without fear or favour. After all, that's the mark of a free and fair press.Most recently, EWN reports that Sanef has commissioned an investigation into editorial integrity, following a meeting with the Tiso Blackstar management following the Sunday Times’ false reporting scandal.News24 reports that while Sanef applauds the publication’s management for owning up to what it calls "serious editorial lapses," the inaccurate reports have had a devastating impact:Breaches of editorial standards have undermined public trust spreading beyond the publication itself, undermining the credibility of journalism for the public good.This as the Mail & Guardian Online reports that more damage is expected in the ‘Sunday Times fake news fallout’, reporting that Sanef’s executive director Kate Skinner had told the Mail & Guardian Sanef wants to strengthen ethics within the industry, specifically within the areas of training and support for journalists across the industry to ensure this does not happen again. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/435410-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Journalism Trust Initiative to combat disinformation is launched" width="120" height="120">The Journalism Trust Initiative to combat disinformation is launchedReporters Without Borders (RSF), and its partners Agence France Presse (AFP), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the Global Editors Network (GEN) have just launched an innovative media self-regulatory initiative designed to combat disinformation online - called the Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI)...4 Apr 2018According to Skinner, this saga has highlighted the “tricky” political situations which journalists have to navigate.A good call, given the current fake news climate.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1810/463418-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Media literacy: Five fact-checking tips for the fake news era" width="120" height="120">Media literacy: Five fact-checking tips for the fake news eraEase of access to social media and editing tools have made it easier than ever to spread stories and images that have people shaking their heads, thinking "That can't be real... can it?

Sad, but true. It’s on all of us to rebuild that trust in the media, whether we’re part of the mainstream media set, publish to our own blogs or share news on social media.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1706/395696-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Brian Jackson ©" width="120" height="120">Newspapers build loyal audiences with quality journalismKey findings from the Wan-Ifra's annual World Press Trends survey were presented at the 69th World News Media Congress and 24th World Editors Forum in Durban...7 Jun 2017One of the best ways to ensure more factual reporting is to be held accountable for the results.Dr Gleb Tsipursky, cofounder of the Pro-Truth Pledge project in the US, contacted me after my recent article addressing fake news, which he calls, “a topic that needs a lot more attention and clarification”.Tsipursky shared that the Pro-Truth Pledge is one way of doing so. 12 tips to keep in mind when you share, honour and encourage truthIt's a project dedicated to clarifying the fuzzy concept of ‘truth’ and fighting misinformation and incivility through combining behavioural science with crowdsourcing, the Pro-Truth Pledge is focused on the following three pillars, which should be the basis of any media outlet:Share truth1. Verify:  fact-check information to confirm it is true before accepting and sharing it2. Balance:  share the whole truth, even if some aspects do not support my opinion3. Cite:  share my sources so that others can verify my information4. Clarify:  distinguish between my opinion and the factsHonour truth5. Acknowledge:  when others share true information, even when we disagree otherwise6. Re-evaluate:  if my information is challenged, retract it if I cannot verify it7. Defend:  others when they come under attack for sharing true information, even when we disagree otherwise8. Align:  my opinions and actions with true informationEncourage truth9. Fix:  ask people to retract information that reliable sources have disproved, even if they are my allies10. Educate:  compassionately inform those around me to stop using unreliable sources even if these sources support my opinion11. Defer:  recognise the opinions of experts as more likely to be accurate when the facts are disputed12. Celebrate:  those who retract incorrect statements and update their beliefs toward the truthA worthy ‘publishing ethics refresh’ for all of us.
