Pushing through every barrier, the Decimal team put together a proposal that not just blew away Shaun Prithivirajh, the new CEO of Ellies, but the entire marketing team. Voloshnee Pandaram, Marketing Executive, said, “We found Decimal Agency to be a great fit, their positive attitude, vibrant personalities and fresh creative concepts made the selection process that much easier. It is a very exciting time for us and we look forward to working with Decimal, together the sky's the limit.” The excitement was shared on behalf of Decimal Agency: “We’re excited about the success in creating awareness and sentiment for a legendary South African brand,” said Raffaele Mc Creadie, Director of Decimal Agency. Bearing in mind the history of Ellies, founded in 1979, Decimal Agency look to the future with Ellies and hope to create work that not just grows Ellies, but also cements their status as the leader in technology within the South African market. In addition to their partnership with Decimal, Ellies will in turn work with COLAB, a collaboration between iRam, Atomic Marketing and Decimal Agency which will be the overarching agency that oversees creative, marketing activations and data management. "We look forward to building a lasting relationship with Ellies and creating work that people can relate to,” said Jarred Leslie, Senior Art Director of Decimal Agency. Here’s to new partnerships with legendary South African brands, kudos to the team at Decimal.
