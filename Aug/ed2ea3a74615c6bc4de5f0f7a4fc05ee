I was catapulted from my comfort blanket of analogue PR practice into a world of domain authority, keywords, PPC, SEO, influencers, E-PR, Google ranking and link building; it was terrifying. Although I often fall back on the original tenets of the press release, pitching and networking, I’ve had to learn to surf the tsunami of digital with willing agility.If you were unsure of integrating digital into your PR offering, familiarise yourself with these numbers. Last week The Audit Bureau of Circulations of South Africa released the consumer-magazine circulation stats for the period April–June 2018 (ABC Q2 2018), the results are alarming but not a surprise:Total magazine circulation declined by 3.9% on the previous quarter, and by 15.1% on the prior yearConsumer magazines decreased by 6.2% on the previous quarter, and by 11.5% on the prior yearB2B Magazines declined by 2.8%on the previous quarter, and by 5.1% on the prior yearCustom Magazines declined by 1.7% on the prior quarter, and by 20.5% on the prior yearFree magazines declined by 4.2% on the prior quarter, and by 10% on the prior year<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452945-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Newspapers ABC Q2 2018: Static, with some highlights" width="120" height="120">Newspapers ABC Q2 2018: Static, with some highlightsThe second quarter of the 2018 Audit Bureau of Circulations of South Africa (ABC) shows a static Total Newspaper circulation compared to the previous quarter...By Danette Breitenbach 14 Aug 2018<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452989-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Magazines ABC Q2 2018: Decline continues" width="120" height="120">Magazines ABC Q2 2018: Decline continuesThe decline in magazine circulation continued unabated.

Organisations have had to restructure digital, social and PR silos by removing marketing discipline boundaries to prevent people from retreating into their old bunkers. We’ve entered an age of collaboration and multifunctional job roles and whilst everyone can’t do everything; for best campaign success, your teams need to integrate communication practices. Brut force procedure is how you don’t go about this; coercing teams into an environment of learning is how you’ll get their attention. Lunch and learnCirca 2003, my boss implemented mandatory “read and pitch” coffees. Every Friday morning, we were presented with a pile of newspapers (the UK had 5 daily newspapers on shelf on any given day), cappuccinos and muffins. Not only did I learn about the vastly different conducts of newspaper nuance; left wing, middle-road and hard right but it nurtured a hunger in me that still exists – an insatiable desire for media, content and news; this keeps me relevant, creative and proactive. Monthly “lunch-and-learn” meetings in an informal environment will kick-start a culture of collaboration, exploration and upskilling. Most of my industry-critical skills were learned from colleagues who painstakingly navigated me through the minefield of Google Display Networks, social media ad models, search text and the rest. Digital marketing is a multivariate exercise of trial and error, so who better to share war wounds and success stories than the people in the trenches?
