These accolades, along with the coveted Agency of the Year award, are the result of Joe Public United’s constant drive to do better than their best, and then better still, year after year. And as 2018 marks the group’s 20th birthday, winning this title for the first time makes it an especially historic moment.Add to this the irrefutable evidence that award-winning creativity is a lot more effective in growing brands and businesses, and receiving these accolades becomes even more satisfying. As Joe Public United exists to grow its people, clients and country, these awards prove that we are indeed living our purpose. If there’s any remaining doubt about just how seriously the agency takes its Growthn philosophy – the arrival of its ‘One Stride at a Time’ team on the DStv Seminar of Creativity stage, after completing a 700km journey to Loeries on foot to raise funds for Joe Public’s One School at a Time initiative, is all the proof anyone could ask for.To achieve this, 42 runners set off from Joe Public’s doors on Tuesday, 14 August, and handed over their collective kilometres to the core long-distance team of 11, who then ran the remaining distance to the ICC in Durban on Friday, 17 August, to be greeted by some of the country’s top creatives, marketers and international speakers. For Joe Public United, this year’s Loeries therefore represented a landmark triumph over every kind of blood, sweat and tears along its constant and uncompromising Growth journey: arriving on foot to shine a light on the One School at a Time cause, and leaving with a fleet of Gold Loeries, plus the coveted Agency of the Year title.It is undeniable that awards are more than just mere creative accolades. They are evidence of the calibre of creative business solutions that Joe Public United offers its clients. Our success at this year’s Loeries Awards is dedicated to the clients we have partnered with, who are willing to pursue creative excellence and who recognise it as the key to the growth of their brands. And not least, it’s a tribute to our people’s relentless pursuit of excellence in the growth of their craft.Awards table below:Award  Catagory  Brand  Agency  CampaignGoldDirect MailGreatStockJoe PublicThe Anthology of Great (Stock) PoetrySilverOutdoor MediaPOWAJoe Public UnitedNews you need to seeBronzeOutdoor MediaKeepit100Joe Public IgniteBurning BillboardGoldTactical Use of NewspaperPOWAJoe Public UnitedNews you need to seeCampaign SilverIndoor PostersChicken LickenJoe Public UnitedA Little Hungry – Temple, Mine, BankCampaign Craft GoldPrint Craft – IllustrationChicken LickenJoe Public UnitedA Little Hungry – Temple, Mine, BankCraft GoldPrint Craft – WritingGreatStockJoe PublicThe Anthology of Great (Stock) PoetryCampaign Craft CertificatePrint Crafts – Art DirectionOne School at at TimeJoe Public UnitedEducation is a Weapon - Crime, Poverty, IgnoranceCampaign BronzePR & Media Communication CampaignApartheid MuseumJoe Public UnitedBill of RightsSilverAmbientApartheid MuseumJoe Public UnitedBill of RightsBonzeMedia Innovation – Single MediumApartheid MuseumJoe Public UnitedBill of RightsCampaign SilverRadio Station CommercialsChicken LickenJoe Public UnitedFar Fetched - Spike Lee, Catch it, KissCampaign BronzeInternet & Media Audio CommercialsVoicebankJoe PublicSearching for Talent - Moshidi, Louise, Murray, AnelleBronzeSA Non-English Radio Station CommercialsJetJoe Public UnitedJet's plus-size rangeBronzeSA Non-English Radio Station CommercialsChicken LickenJoe Public UnitedDangerCampaign Craft CertificateRadio Crafts - WritingChicken LickenJoe Public UnitedFar Fetched - Spike Lee, Kiss, Catch itSilverTV & Cinema Commercials – above 90sChicken LickenJoe Public UnitedSbu 2.0Campaign BronzeTV Trailers & Content PromosCell CJoe Public UnitedTwisted Trailers - Cloverfield, World War Z, A Beautiful MindCraft CertificateFilm Crafts - Best Use of Licensed MusicChicken LickenJoe PublicSbu 2.0Campaign SilverEffective Creativity Chicken LickenJoe Public UnitedAfronautCraft GoldFilm Crafts - DirectionChicken LickenJoe Public & Romance FilmsSbu 2.0Craft GoldFilm Crafts – Production DesignChicken LickenJoe Public & Romance FilmsSbu 2.0Craft GoldFilm Crafts – AnimationChicken LickenJoe Public, Bladeworks & Chocolate TribeSbu 2.0Craft GoldFilm Crafts - PerformanceChicken LickenJoe Public & Romance FilmsSbu 2.0Craft CertificateFilm Crafts - Original Music & Sound DesignChicken LickenJoe Public & Produce SoundSbu 2.0Film Crafts - CinematographyFilm Crafts - CinematographyChicken LickenJoe Public & They Shoot FilmsIcelandic BoyCraft CertificateFilm Crafts - AnimationChicken LickenJoe Public & Chocolate TribeJony Ive SboofedCraft CertificateFilm Crafts - PerformanceChicken LickenJoe Public & They Shoot FilmsIcelandic BoyCraft CertificateFilm Crafts - Direction Chicken LickenJoe Public & They Shoot FilmsIcelandic BoyCraft CertificateFilm Crafts - CinematographyNedbankJoe Public & 0307 FilmsBirds Eye ViewAgency of the YearJoe Public UnitedSee more: Joe Public YouTube & WebsiteFor more:Bizcommunity search: Loeries Creative Week DurbanGoogle news search: LoeriesTwitter search: LoeriesOfficial site: www.loeries.com, Facebook, Twitter, InstagramMore info: Creative Week Durban overview
