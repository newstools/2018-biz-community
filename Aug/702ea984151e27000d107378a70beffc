The Absa ReadyToWork campaign connected with soccer fans of the Absa Premiership which allowed for impressive engagement and life changing opportunities for those involved in the programme. The core objective of the campaign was to drive registration on the ReadyToWork platform and aligning this objective with the fans of the Absa Premiership delivered a tenfold return on registrations.The incentive for registering for the ReadyToWork campaign was an internship to work on the Absa Premiership. The successful interns were mentored and trained over the course of a month by Absa, SuperSport and Playmakers Sponsorship as they learnt about working on the biggest football league in Africa. To amplify the campaign, content was produced with PSL Communication Manager Luxolo September, Gallo Photographer Lefty Shivambo and Michael Munzhedzi Peter Mokaba Groundsmen to give insight on what it means to work in different roles around the Absa Premiership.  Matt Ellenbogen, Playmakers Managing Director said, “These Sport Industry Award wins prove that leveraging human and societal insights continues to be the foundation of award winning work. This campaign demonstrates that sponsorship as a medium has the power to integrate with Corporate Social Responsibility and produce meaningful work for our clients and those impacted by their programmes and communities they operate in. As an agency we set ourselves high standards and we believe this recognition reaffirms for us and our clients that we are on the right track. We thank our valued clients - Absa, KFC and Pernod Ricard South Africa, who constantly challenge us to push boundaries in all our work.”The Sport Industry Awards celebrates the best work in the business of sport and showcases all the best campaigns that have been completed during the previous award cycle.
