As you know, bread is a big part of our South African heritage, be it in a form of a kota, bunny chow or sphatlo. The Festival is a natural fit for the brand, I mean what’s a kota without a soft tasty loaf of bread from a trusted brand that has over 85 years of experience.” The festival is a great platform for the SASKO brand to partner with and support some of the Kasi food vendors around Soweto and the neighbouring townships. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/455421.jpg" alt="Sasko renews its sponsorship of the Soweto Kota Festival" width="500" height="229">Mnyamana continues, “Last year we gave away great prizes to the value of R30,000 to some of the vendors in the form of marketing support.  This year we are planning to give away more prizes, not only to the vendors but we plan to delight guests on the day with great prizes too.” Consumers attending the Sasko Soweto Kota Festival should look forward to an even better experience in 2018. The event has moved from Soweto Theatre to The Walter Sisulu Square in order to accommodate more vendors and allow for a great experience and ease for everyone.  Expect to see collaboration from different brands in a quest to make the event bigger and better than 2017. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/455422.jpg" alt="Sasko renews its sponsorship of the Soweto Kota Festival" width="500" height="333">The festival will take place on 8 and 9 September this year and will see traditional kasi-inspired kotas, and innovative new-age kotas on offer to those who attend.  “It’s a great way to spend a weekend, celebrating our heritage and sampling the best kotas in Soweto. We are always blown away by the creativity and high standards produced by the various kota vendors on the day,” says Mnyamana. “September is Heritage month and Sasko is a brand that is steeped in heritage. The Sasko Soweto Kota Festival is a celebration of our own heritage and an opportunity for us to spend time with the people who make the Sasko brand what it is today.” For more information, visit Sasko’s website, call the customer care on 0800 022000, follow the brand on Twitter or head to the Sasko’s Facebook page for regular updates.
