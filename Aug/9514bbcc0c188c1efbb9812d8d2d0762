The aim of the project is to help girls in Bloemfontein, who don’t have the financial means, to make their matric dance wishes come true.Says OFM General Manager, Nick Efstathiou: “Most of us remember our matric dance with fond memories. It’s the one night in your life where you want to look and feel your best. In a sense, you’re saying goodbye to your childhood and entering adulthood. Many girls don’t have the financial means to get that special dress for this special occasion. Hopefully, through the Mangaung Princess Project, we can make some of these girls’ dreams come true!” Listeners can nominate themselves or anyone they know, who needs a dress, by going to the OFM website and completing the nomination form. OFM is also calling on all its loyal listeners to donate any ball gowns, evening dresses, shoes or accessories and to drop off these items at Central Media’s offices in Christo Groenewald Street, Wild Olive Estate.  “Now is the time to donate those beautiful evening gowns that no longer fit, or that is taking up valuable closet space! Don’t let all that money spent on a beautiful dress go to waste! Make someone else’s night by supporting this project,” says Efstathiou.Companies and individuals, who want to donate their products or skills – for example, make-up, shoes, photography and hair styling – are also welcome to contact Shireen on 074 498 8866 and Janke 076 812 8189.
