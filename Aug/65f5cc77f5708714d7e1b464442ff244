The Kfm Mornings team wanted to add to LottoStar’s generous donation and throw the Cape’s Biggest Baby Shower. They brought Clicks on board, and through the Clicks Helping Hand Trust, gave listeners across Cape Town the chance to donate baby supplies and goods at four major Clicks stores across the Cape," said Stephen Werner, Kfm Programme Manager. Werner added: “When Darren, Sherlin and Sibs heard that Inga did not have the traditional baby shower experience, the team wanted to do something special to celebrate her journey into motherhood. Kfm Mornings hosted a beautiful pink and blue shower experience with Inga’s family and those who have supported her in her journey as a new mum. This included close to 800 000 people of the Western Cape who were able to experience the event via the live broadcast and our social channels."   Capetonians supported the Mafenuka quadruplets with baby supplies. The Clicks Helping Hands Trust will match these donations and will support the babies with product and baby clothes for the next few years. Clicks, CSI Coordinator, Donna Davids made the announcement during the baby shower held at the Kfm studios this morning.  Kfm 94.5 has made the commitment to follow the story of Inga and her four babies and keep close tabs on the ‘Cape’s Quads’ and their lives.  Further celebrations of their key milestones are expected soon.  For more on Kfm 94.5 and the Mafenuka babies click kfm.co.za, or follow the station on social media: @KfmZA.
