In an interview with Designboom, Selldorf said that she came from a family of designers. Her father was an architect and her mother was an interior designer.So, in some ways, it might have been inevitable that I would become an architect as well. I did initially consider other things but quickly came to realise that architecture was a profession that would allow my creativity to work towards improving the world around me. I believe that architecture profoundly shapes our experience of the world and can contribute to making a more diverse, equitable and sustainable future.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/453027-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Wanuri Kahiu | © ." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2019: Wanuri Kahiu announced as speakerRenowned filmmaker and author Wanuri Kahiu has been announced as one of the speakers at the 2019 Design Indaba...By Juanita Pienaar 3 days agoSelldorf received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Pratt Institute and a Master of Architecture degree from Syracuse University in Florence, Italy.

Her firm creates public and private spaces that manifest a clear and modern sensibility to enduring impact. The company’s guiding principles have been deeply rooted in humanism and designs for the individual experience. As a result, its work is brought to life and made complete by those who use it.Being a notable architect in a field that is notorious for having very few women, Selldorf said in a Los Angeles Times article that she thinks women do make a difference in the field because they talk about things in a slightly different way. I think that women by and large are brought up to be more collaborative. This may not sound good, but they are brought up to be more accepting of different voices and to find consensus – that does not defy leadership, and I don't think it has any effect on form-making or design. There are women who do very different things than I do, but I think there is something to the way that we talk about it that is different.Couldn’t agree more. Catch Selldorf at the 2019 Design Indaba where she will join a stellar selection of international speakers whose compelling presentations combine career-changing insights and the most cutting-edge work on the global circuit.
