We are proud to have won in this category because the execution was so stand-out. Having the nation’s largest newspaper underline names in their editorial in order to bring your idea to life, was quite a thing.

It addressed something that affects millions of people every day. We spotted the red line and decided to do something about it. Our solution was simple but imaginative – that always connects with people. Simple, powerful ideas that people can get behind and feel part of..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about the thinking behind the idea?Spellcheck’s red line appears under any name that isn’t a traditional English name. That means that every day, millions of South Africans are made to feel like their names are a mistake. That’s just not fair. How in 2018 can our software still be discriminatory against people with non-English names?So Nando’s decided to challenge the status quo, as they always do, and fix this for South Africans. We asked people to submit their names to a database, which was then made available to the public on Human Right’s day for download. By simply updating your computer’s dictionary, typical South African names no longer get the red line in all Word documents.
