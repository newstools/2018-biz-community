OFM Nights will be hosted by popular presenter Enriko Klopper from 19h00 to 22h00. The new show will be more in line with OFM’s daytime offering, i.e. playing popular hits, South African and Afrikaans music and adding a pop of brand-new music. The new show will make for easy listening with plenty of old and new favourites for the listening pleasure of a much broader audience. We’ll then turn things up a notch in A Touch of Thabang, Mondays to Thursdays from 22h00 to 01h00 with award-winning presenter Thabang Moselane. This show will be aimed at the 15 to 24 market with music and content to match!

Finally, Alucius Mocumi will make Central South Africa party the whole weekend long in The Boom Box – Fridays from 22h00 to 01h00. In this show, the Global Top 30 Top 10 recap will take centre stage from 22h00 to 23h00, followed by the SuperMix and finally at 24h00 a mix with DJ Vinyl’s. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/455642-625x208.jpg" alt="OFM ringing the changes in September" width="625" height="208">September is also More Music Month – with even more music and more ways to win on the Sound of Your Life.
