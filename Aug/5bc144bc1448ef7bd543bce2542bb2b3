We are very proud to have composed the original music for the Allan Gray campaign, "Father's Share”, which picked up numerous Loeries, including a Silver Film Loerie. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/454915-625x164.jpg" alt="Howard Audio kills two birds with one trumpet!" width="625" height="164">We are also thrilled that the Universal Music radio tribute for Bra Hugh Masekela picked up a Craft Loerie for original music. Adam Howard explains, “I am thrilled once again Howard Audio has been a part of some amazing creative work that has been awarded at the Loeries and these two pieces of work I composed are quite special to me as both briefs dictated a trumpet/flugel horn solo. It was an honour for me to play the solo instrument in this case and having known Bra Hugh personally, the award means even more." Sadly the Hugh Masekela session was one of the last times Adam worked with Lorraine Shanon. We'd like to dedicate that award to her.
