Working freely on reputable brands like Scarfini and Operation Smile is testament to the positive impact we as advertisers have on the world we live in,” says Lurie. Vega students once again exceeded expectations with a total of 17 students making it to the finals – 13 of them were announced as Loerie winners and received four silver and four bronze Birds. In addition, Alecea Basson (Vega CT), Chanre Bosch and Bernedene Clausing (both Vega Pretoria) were named this year’s winners of the coveted Instahack Award, making this the third consecutive year that Vega students have been recognised in this category.
