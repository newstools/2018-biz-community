One of the three screens is located within Johannesburg and the other two are in Port Elizabeth and East London. We have a very clearly defined DOOH roll out strategy, which is to be able to provide one singular point of contact for a NATIONAL DOOH campaign across the country, and each and every new digital we build is developed to complement the network and allow advertisers to get consistent coverage in very specific geographic areas.’’ Says Simon Wall, Managing Director at Tractor Outdoor. “Our development team has put a tremendous amount of work into this roll out and are still currently filtering through existing and new structures to continue growing this network. We are proud of the work we have put in so far and excited about the upcoming movements.” Says Ben Harris, Rights and Development Director at Tractor Outdoor.The LOOP network offers advertisers tailor-made, real-time updates 24/7.
