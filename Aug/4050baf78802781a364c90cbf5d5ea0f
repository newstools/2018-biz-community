In other words, it’s a pizza sized for one, but with a big personality. “While it is a smaller version of the original Triple-Decker®, it still boasts triple the taste, triple the flavour and triple the fun.  It’s a super filling meal you can enjoy by yourself; ideal for people with a big appetite and a taste for big things,” explained Debonairs Pizza Marketing Executive, Toni Joubert. The Big Nyana was created by FCB Joburg Art Director, Vukani Mpanza and Jacque Moodley, and Copywriter, Lucky Kakudi and Sandile Hamilton, together with Creative Director, Greg Cameron with Mfundo Mkhize of Ola Films and Ian Difford of Hungry Films. Post-production was by Tessa Ford Post Production, Orchestra Blue Post Production and Fuel Content. A 30-second commercial with a 20-second cut-down, it is flighting on SABC, e.tv, DStv channels as well as M-Net and Comedy Central. “The word ‘nyana’ means ‘small’ in Northern and Southern SeSotho and, South Africa being the melting pot that it is, its lingo has been adopted by other cultures so that its use and comprehension is fully and universally understood,” explained Cameron.“So, the literal translation for the Big Nyana is ‘a big small thing’. And it works, because it’s a witty oxymoron that completely represents the Small Triple-Decker’s personality.”  Credits:Creative agency: FCB                Business Unit Director: Mogani NaidooAccount Director: Kefilwe KhandaAccount Executive: Kaylyn NaickerChief Creative Officer: Ahmed TillyCreative Director: Greg Cameron             Copywriter: Lucky Kakudi & Sandile Hamilton Art director: Vukani Mpanza & Jacque Moodley  Traffic Manager: Theresa Selema                       Strategic planner: Sandiselwe Gamede & Katherine Anousakis TV production: Linda Hauser                              Media planners: Jedd Cokayne & Sulize Janse Van Vuuren - The Media Shop                   Production companies: Ola Films and Hungry Films                    Directors: Mfundo Mkhize; Ian Difford                Editor: Tessa Ford and Orchestra Blue Post Production                                      Post-production: Tessa Ford Post Production and Fuel Content
