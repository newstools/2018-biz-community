Suddenly, a ‘master chef’ appears. (At this point, let me declare, I am not a great fan of cooking shows, although I do love food… so I did not recognise the man.)He offers advice as the meal comes together in delicious high-definition. And that is the promise of the box: not just the ingredients, but also the instructions and advice so you look like the expert. In no time at all (it seems) the meal gets made and looks really good.The man in the kitchen looks up to where his ghost helper was – and he’s gone.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/453963-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Checkers to launch Ready to Chef meal kits" width="120" height="120">Checkers to launch Ready to Chef meal kitsCheckers will be introducing its own range of meal kits called Ready to Chef, with four different recipes -including a vegetarian option - available in stores each week...20 Aug 2018 Apart from the fact the ad showcases the product perfectly, it is also another example of how Checkers has consistently set the bar high when it comes to visual images of food. They’ve done it in the past with their meat, their cheeses and their wines. It’s so real, you can almost taste it.And if that’s not what the marketing people describe as a “call to action” (get down to the shop and buy it), then I don’t know what is.So, another food-related Orchid for Checkers.It’s no wonder that, these days, Checkers has usurped the place of Woollies as somewhere you go for high-class food…These two pics of tweets – the first from BMW US, and then a follow-up from Audi US – take my fancy because I love comparative and humorous advertising, especially when a brand takes a nudge at a competitor. That’s why BMW’s iconic “Beats the Bends” ad from the 1990s was so appealing.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1806/444525-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrabs from the ad." width="120" height="120">#OrchidsandOnions: Nothing beats this Benz... or the hope that sport can one day unite usIt was one of the most talked-about pieces of marketing in quite a few months, the Mercedes-Benz recreation of its famous 1990 TV commercial, about how one of its brilliantly engineered cars saved the life of its driver when he crashed 100m down the side of Chapman's Peak outside Cape Town...By Brendan Seery 12 Jun 2018Comparative advertising is not only frowned on in this country, it is outlawed and many a campaign has had to be pulled after complaints for a competitor, which feels another brand has besmirched its reputation. Sigh…What happened in these tweets was that BMW decided to showcase its new M4 in front of a spectacular light display. The Audi social media clevers quickly noticed that the lights formed a series of inter-locking rings… just like the Audi logo. So they dropped their take – a subtle “when you see it” message. The tweet went down a treat with the Twitterati. But it didn’t all go Audi’s way. A BMW fan put things into context by noting that an Audi would “always be behind a BMW”. But an Orchid for Audi US for a little marketing fun. BMW itself used that line later.In case you had your head in the sand the whole of last week, the calamitous collapse of businesses related to the “beach racist”, Adam Catzavelos, was a warning about the power of social media. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/454477-120x120.jpg" alt="Too soon, South Africa? #AdamCatzavelos challenge is already a meme" width="120" height="120">Too soon, South Africa? #AdamCatzavelos challenge is already a memeAdam Catzavelos, the South African whose racial slur-loaded video found its way onto Twitter, is already a meme...By Andy Walker 23 Aug 2018Just looking at it from a marketing perspective, I can think of few other examples where the outrage of a social media community had done such damage so quickly.Moral of the story – apart from ‘stay in Europe if you hate black people’ – is be extremely careful about anything you post on social media.
