The project required a complete redesign, greatly influenced by the natural beauty of the Namibian landscape. Users are able to browse through award-winning imagery and explore these vivid landscapes through interactive video technology, that will surely draw the customer in and experience Namibia like never before. Reservations Software Integration - InnkeeperInnkeeper integration allowed the client to sync the availability of all 23 lodges around Namibia in one beautiful system, that serviced all their requirements and objectives brilliantly. The Gondwana Collection is one of the first companies in the tourism sector to integrate the booking system and a custom-built e-commerce shopping cart function seamlessly into a new fully adaptive and responsive website. It is compatible with any electronic device. This project has enabled the Realm Digital team to implement more current technology including Angular, which was used to build the front-end, which in turn upskilled a few of our team members. We were also able to devise a more efficient deployment strategy for releases. “It was an absolute pleasure working with Realm Digital on this e-commerce project. Thank you very much for your input, effort and understanding throughout the last 20 months!” Bernd Grahl Online & Social Media Manager, Gondwana Collection Namibia “Users can now plan their entire Namibian holiday from the comfort of their home, knowing that all routes have been mapped out through the integration of the Google Distance Matrix API, which allows the client to select the optimal drive time between properties, or to recommend another Gondwana accommodation along the route.” Rory McLeanSenior Account Manager, Realm DigitalRead more about this exciting project here:https://www.realmdigital.co.za/project/gondwana-collection-namibia/
