But it seems that some South Africans are finding a more inventive and immediate way to respond to his comments.The hashtag #AdamCatzavelosChallenge briefly trended on Twitter in South Africa on Wednesday afternoon, and with it introduced a new video meme format.The “challenge” sees participants providing their own weather reports, mocking Catzavelos’s video.Some clips have already amassed more than 10,000 views.������ I couldn't help it.

The video also received a RT from DJ Fresh to boot.Just another day in South Africa ���� Have a better day today���� #AdamCatzavelos #AdamCatzavelosChallenge #SouthAfrica #���� #Racism pic.twitter.com/zTe52SzZhI— DavidKau (@davidkau1) August 22, 2018It’s debatable that users should not make light of the seriousness of the video’s prejudice, however, it’s also debatable that mocking the original video is a direct response to the racism presented within it.Nevertheless, some users questioned the challenge as a valid response format.Not everything has to be a challenge.. ���� wow stop #AdamCatzavelosChallenge— Karyn Full Cream (@KareinMayo) August 22, 2018You got to love SA every thing is a challenge, but I'm concerned, will it still be a challenge if a guy rapes a woman and post a vid? #AdamCatzavelosChallenge pic.twitter.com/nqjAj7Pq7L— HUNT DREAMS (@DREAM_DONATER) August 22, 2018However, you feel, it’s clear that the fledgeling meme’s showing no signs of slowing down, at least for the remainder of the week.
