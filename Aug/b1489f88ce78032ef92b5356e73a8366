Where do you live, work and play?I live in Tokai in the Western Cape, I work at Primedia Broadcasting and work on brands like Kfm and Cape Talk.  Cape Town is my playground!2. What’s your claim to fame? Does doing a radio commercial when I was 4-years-old count?  I am a sports junkie, having completed 12 Comrades Marathons and 3 Iron Man events, to name a few. Finishing in the top 30 of the Two Oceans Ultra marathon was a massive highlight for me. 3. Describe your career so far. My career has centred on media, which is exactly the field I wanted to pursue when I was still at school. I have always been very selective about the companies and roles that I have taken on, and this has really served me. My background is marketing and sales, as I was a sales director for many years before getting into marketing.With my background, I can understand the commerce side of the business and constructing B2B strategies. My marketing background gives me a clear understanding of brand strategies and B2C type strategies. So, it’s a good mix that does help with the overall general management of a media business.I have loved my career so far, and despite many very difficult patches, these times are critical for one’s own resilience and character development. It makes one a better leader.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/407833-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nicolaides, Mortlock and Lindeque in action." width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: Inside the truth of the female-strong EWN newsroomYour worst nightmares often form the harsh realities of daily work life for the females in Primedia Broadcasting's EWN newsroom.

What do you love about your industry? It’s a very exciting industry to be in, as it’s fast-paced and ever-changing. Being in broadcasting is a huge privilege and a responsibility that I take very seriously, as we are connecting with millions of South African’s every day.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Well, firstly I drive to work, listening to our two radio brands. There is no rhythm to my work day, but it ranges between meetings with clients, unpacking research on our brands and what it means to our brand strategies.I work closely with our senior management team on the various operational drivers of our business, whilst keeping a close eye on our company strategy. It’s important for a strategy to come alive as a daily practice, so I’m always checking our actions and decisions against our strategic map.I also have an open-door policy, so I spend time with staff having good conversations about our business, the environment and our future. It’s important to be alert to ideas from all corners of an organisation. 7. What are the tools of your trade?

List a few pains points the industry can improve on. Different currencies when it comes to audience measurementsNot enough robust discussions between industry stakeholders to improve overall product and service delivery, to grow the industry rather than erode market shareTalent retentionTalent attractionThere are certainly not enough women at director level within the industry, which is problematic. Women in leadership positions need to play an active role in coaching and mentoring other women, and ensuring there is a support structure in place to accelerate the promotion of women into top media positions.10. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry now, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. My worst buzzword is ‘infotainment’. No! I have stolen a catchphrase from our Primedia chairperson, Phumzile Langeni:We need to be careful not to mark our own homework. – I love that.We must be careful not to buy into our own PR. We need to constantly be humble, curious and eager to learn and get better. 11. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Generally when I’m exercising, so when I’m running or swimming. 12. Are you a technophobe or a technophile?I love technology and what it enables. I find it fascinating and am always curious about new innovations and consumer adoption. So, I am super interested in the theory but particularly useless at “being” a tech junkie.  13. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Lots of pictures of Cape Town and my dogs!14. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? ”Success is often overlooked, because it’s dressed up in overalls and looks like hard work” – Anthony Robbins.Simple as that.
