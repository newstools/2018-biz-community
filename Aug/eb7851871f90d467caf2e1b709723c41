We commit to contribute in building Red Cherry to great heights and new glory both as the biggest media house and production house in Mzansi,” said Pheladi Mphahlele. Pheladi is the current deputy CEO tipped to take over from Mike in January as CEO and lead Red Cherry Interactive into a new dawn.  “We at the Be Sure Group saw an opportunity to increase our media footprint and the acquisition of Red Cherry with a strong track record made perfect sense,” says Sammy Mashita. We see the growth of Be Sure Group through shareholding of Be Sure Media in Red Cherry as a strategic and necessary move. Red Cherry have recently built two new studios and with that, secured long term contracts. They still continue to “Dare to be Different” by offering creative media solutions and with a strong cutting-edge Production component to the business, it has increased their overall offerings considerably.About Red Cherry: Red Cherry Interactive is an interactive branded content company who works with clients and agencies to: Produce branded content: TV and radio commercials, shows, AVs, digital content Book media: TV/radio/print or any other media bookings Run supporting activations: Branded vehicles Conceptualise and execute concepts and campaigns from start to finishLearn more about how Red Cherry Interactive can benefit your brand, contact us on (011) 807 2531 or at info@redcherry.co.zabRev('brev-9c384e1b-f0dd-4a09-aadd-ee196404586c', '>a/\<az.oc.yrrehcder@ofni>"az.oc.yrrehcder;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
