The home has sheltered more than a thousand children since its establishment in 2000. The children’s home has recently embarked on the goliath task of expanding their facilities to accommodate their ever-growing needs. Gallagher Convention Centre has always endeavoured to be involved with the many projects the home undertakes to grow and evolve with the needs of their charges. On Tuesday, 19 August 2018, Gallagher Convention Centre supported the New Jerusalem Children’s Home by donating curtains to the home, to cover windows and sliding doors in their new buildings.The compassionate and devoted team at the New Jerusalem Children’s Home gratefully receives any form of support for the home and believes that all contributions will make a positive impact on the future of the children.
