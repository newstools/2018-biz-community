As specialists in curved cabinetry and lavish kitchen designs, Curves & Bevels Designer Kitchens is set to astound audiences with their masterpiece Decorex Joburg feature, which reflects a number of global kitchen trends. “Embracing the concept of ‘diversity’, the curves used in the design will showcase the diverse nature of curves and how they can be applied without limits,” said Ann-Donne Strydom of Curves & Bevels Designer Kitchens. “Trends are not necessarily limited to strictly linear lines, rather edges are softened by carefully placed curves. The geometry of the design makes the kitchen a showpiece, which fits into the open-living feature of the modern kitchen design.” In order to stand a chance to ‘Win a Kitchen Competition by Curves & Bevels Designer Kitchens’, visitors need to get the Curves & Bevels Designer Kitchens’ stand at Decorex Joburg. Anyone attending the exhibition can enter the contest and stand a chance to win the R300,000 custom-made kitchen designed by Curves & Bevels Designer Kitchens, with counter tops crafted by Silestone, door finishes by Seno SA, fittings and hardware by Grass ZA and appliances by Bosch.
