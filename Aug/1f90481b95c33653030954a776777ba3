The BASA Awards recognise the contributions of the business sector to the arts across all genres. The announcement was made at a breakfast at Hollard’s Villa Arcadia head office campus in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Tuesday. BASA chairperson Andre le Roux congratulated the finalists and thanked Hollard for its ongoing support of the arts in general and the BASA Awards specifically. This support, he said, enabled BASA to continue building the narrative between South African businesses and artists. Hollard’s Chief Marketing Officer, Heidi Brauer, said art is in Hollard’s blood. “This year’s theme of legacy and the idea that it is each generation’s duty to build and develop the next, resonates strongly with Hollard’s purpose, which is to enable more people to create and secure a better future. The building of warm, mutually respectful partnerships between businesses and artists enables artists to enjoy financial and promotional support, while businesses become better through embracing creativity.” Hollard has been a BASA Awards partner since 2013 and brings enormous value to BASA’s work to integrate the creative sector into the mainstream economy of the land. Legacy is the theme of the 20187 BASA Awards, partnered by Hollard. Finalist diversity showcases the vital role of arts-business partnerships in preserving and building inclusivity and heritage. This is the 21st iteration of the awards, and this year’s entries have been incredibly competitive, said BASA judging panel chairperson Kojo Baffoe who has been a BASA Awards judge since 2012. The judges treat each entry with the intensity and significance it deserves, he said. “It's great that we’ve seen a steady growth in both quantity and quality of BASA Awards entries. It shows that business now sees the value of investing in creatives, and in the creative economy of the land.” There are 30 finalists in 11 categories of the awards. They encompass partnerships that include businesses from the construction, financial, tourism and hospitality, professional services, media and publishing, property, broadcast, information technology and education sectors. Speaking about this year’s Legacy theme and the role arts-business partnerships play in artists’ lives, BASA CEO Michelle Constant said such partnerships become enablers for new market growth. Artists are empowered to take solid business principles on board, enabling them to build successful careers. “BASA-facilitated partnerships further independent, reflective and critical social commentary. This keeps our nation growing and moving forward. It also drives economic growth that, in turn, benefits everybody.” Here follows the full list of the 2018 BASA Awards, partnered by Hollard finalists: Beyond Borders Partnership Award  Absa Group Limited & the South African National Association for the Visual Arts (SANAVA) for the Absa L'Atelier  PPC Cement SA & National Gallery of Zimbabwe for the PPC Imaginarium Zimbabwe  Rand Merchant Bank & Assitej SA for the Cradle of Creativity Cultural Tourism Award, Supported by Nedbank  PPC Cement SA & Dr Beyers Naudé Local Municipality for the The Owl House  Tollman Bouchard Finlayson (Pty) Ltd & Hermanus FynArts for the Hermanus FynArts 2017 Development Award  Standard Bank & Paleontological Scientific Trust (PAST) for All From One-Walking Tall  Benton Lutaaya & The Project Space for the Young Female Residency Award Strauss & Co Fine Art Auctioneers, ArtInsure, The Forum Company &	Artist Proof Studio and Turbine Art Fair for the A Collector’s Passion, An Exhibition of Pierneef work and a collaboration with Artist Proof Studio, Student Project, Interpreting Pierneef Rand Merchant Bank & Drama for Life for the 2017 Drama for Life Festival and Conversations (The Body Politic: Beyond Headlines, Heartlines and Hashtags) First-Time Sponsor Award  Aluminum Trading Group (Pty) Ltd & James Delaney for ringing the Wilds Park back to life with sculptures BNP Paribas Group (including BNP Paribas Personal Finance SA & French Institute of South Africa (IFAS)) for Molière’s Tartuffe The Fulcrum Group & The Fordsburg Artists' Studio t/a Bag Factory Artists' Studios for the Fulcrum Suzanne Shaw Creative Award Increasing Access to the Arts Award  Rand Merchant Bank & Moving into Dance Mophatong for Enable Through Dance  Nedbank Limited & the Arts & Culture Trust for the ACT│DALRO│Nedbank Scholarship Programme  Spier Wine Farm & Spier Arts Trust for the Spier Artisan Studio Stellenbosch Innovation Award  Instinctif Partners Africa & Rouge Entertainment	for the Support Women in Hip Hop Campaign  Liberty Group & Design Indaba for the Arch for Arch project  Pop Art Studios (Pty) Ltd & Kiri Pink Nob (Pty) Ltd for the J.Bobs Live: A game show double bill Long-Term Partnership Award  Eurocape Holdings (Pty) Ltd & Turn Style 177 t/a The Rainbow Academy (NPO) for The Rainbow Academy  Rand Merchant Bank & Drama for Life for the Mvuso Schools and Community Education Project Southern African Music Rights Organisation (SAMRO) & South African Association for Jazz Education (SAJE) for the 5th SAJE Jazz Festival Strauss & Co and Fordsburg Artists' Studios t/a Bag Factory Artists' Studios for the Cassirer Welz Award Media Sponsorship Award  DeskLink Media & Creative Feel magazine for the Creative Feel magazine and digital platform  Kaya FM & Vuyani Dance Theatre for the Cion: Requiem of Ravel’s Bolero New Pan Hellenic Voice &	Artsvark for the Arts Podcasts Small Business Award CN&CO in collaboration with Ann Roberts for the SA Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale  Lefika Computer CC & Mpumalanga Traditional Arts Market for the Mpumalanga Traditional Arts Market (MTAM)  Tshidaho Construction & LIGSAK Events and Consultant for the 5th Spar Annual Music Festival Sponsorship In-Kind Award  Black Africa & Wits Art Museum (WAM) For the Warhol Unscreened Artworks from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Collection  Exclusive Books & The Market Theatre Foundation and The Coloured Cube for, The Exclusive Books Pan African Reading Room and Pan African Reading Lounge at the Windybrow Arts Centre Reed Exhibitions & Creative Business Cup for the Creative Business Cup South Africa Competition Strategic Project Award  Aspire Art Auctions for the Artist's Resale Rights (ARR) Project  Benon Lutaaya & The Project Space for the Young Female Residency Award  Mazars & French Institute of South Africa (IFAS) for Moliére's Tartuffe  Bank of America Merrill Lynch & Wits Art Museum (WAM) for the Andy Warhol Unscreened The winners will be announced at the BASA Awards event at Victoria Yards, Lorentzville in Johannesburg, on 16 September.
