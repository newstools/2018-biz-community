The company’s internal investigations, in which all sources were submitted for further verification, revealed that seven of the 27 quotes it used in the campaign appear to be in question as to their true authenticity. The campaign, which is no longer on the airwaves, was a three-part series for the Apartheid Museum which compared the quotes of famous people in history. The campaign juxtaposing Verwoerd and Trump won an award at The Loeries Awards a week ago. The campaign drew attention to a message which remains highly relevant – similarities in quotes made by apartheid architect Dr H. F. Verwoerd and US President Donald Trump. “We apply research and fact-checking in our work and it was never our intention to attribute the wrong quotes to anyone. For that we unreservedly apologise. We made a mistake and should have dug deeper. But let this be a lesson for all, that even trusted sources need to be questioned,” says Group CEO TBWA\South Africa Sean Donovan. The four questionable sources were from a purported speech, a book which is currently in circulation and a major international newspaper, specifically an opinion article from the New York Times. “We apologise for taking those sources at face value and had no malicious intent to misrepresent the facts,” added Donovan. “Tragically, this campaign tells a sad truth that parts of our society seemed to have learnt little from the hideous past. Seven of the quotes are questionable, but let’s not forget that heartbreakingly, 20 are correct. The message and the institute of The Apartheid Museum are as current and necessary now as they ever have been, and we will continue to work tirelessly to bring their important message to as many people as possible.” TBWA is in communication with The Loeries and has provided full details of their investigation. As a proactive measure and to ensure the integrity of the Apartheid Museum, the agency has pulled the campaign and has handed the awards it won back.
