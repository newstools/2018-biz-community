I want rural people to have access to information because informed people make informed choices and decisions.”Chinese Ambassador to Malawi, Liu Hongyang, said the project was a concrete reflection of China-Malawi friendship and cooperation. Liu disclosed that through the project, China will also donate 500 sets of solar digital TV integrated with decoders, 1,000 sets of solar projector TV systems, and 10,000 sets of digital decoders.The country’s rural masses are expected to have access to at least 21 TV channels through the project, including three local channels.
