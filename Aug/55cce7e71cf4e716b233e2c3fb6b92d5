The first step is democratising the creative business itself by making it accessible to kids in townships, which is why I started Blackboard alongside Tseliso Rangaka and SJ Myeza, an initiative that raises awareness for our industry in high schools. The second step is encouraging clients to play a more meaningful role in society – beyond just selling products.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/451138-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nkanyezi Masango is The Skulls 2018 chair of judges" width="120" height="120">Nkanyezi Masango is The Skulls 2018 chair of judgesThe Perth Advertising and Design Club (PADC) has announced Cape Town as The Skulls 2018 judging city with King James CD Nkanyezi Masango as chair of judges...31 Jul 2018I interviewed Masango to find out what this opportunity means to him and for SA, as Cape Town is this year’s judging city….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Congratulations on becoming chair of judges for the Perth Advertising and Design Club’s The Skulls 2018. How do you feel about it/what does it mean to you?I’ve always admired Australian advertising and design. So, to have the opportunity to play such a key role at Skulls 2018 – where the work is going to be of a high calibre – is an enormous honour. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does it mean for SA, that Cape Town is this year’s judging city?It confirms that our diverse culture and creativity have become respected globally. It’s also a great opportunity for the two creative communities to inspire each other and exchange ideas. Besides, who wouldn’t want to come judge in such a gorgeous city? Maybe we might end up being the next Cannes – except the wine is affordable..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does your role as chair of judges entail?As chair of judges my role is to select local judges for each of the four juries, and then I’ll be driving the objectives of Skulls and helping ensure that the judging process is fair – for instance, if there are debates I’ll make sure everyone’s point of view is heard. I’ll also be flying to Perth to do a talk at PADC and take part at the ceremony on the awards night..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about this opportunity?I’m excited to see the work from Perth. Some of my creative heroes like Matt Eastwood come from Perth, so clearly the city produces great minds. I can’t wait to draw inspiration from the new wave of creativity that’s coming out of there and meet the creatives behind it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career and being a creative director in particular?I just love the challenge of solving problems with creativity. Every day presents a new problem which leads to a fresh creative solution.I think creative direction is about generosity. It’s quite a selfless process because you spend a lot of your time helping others be better, and when your team achieves success, that’s so rewarding.Fortunately, I work with insanely talented people, which makes my job very fulfilling. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has been your greatest learning?The greatest learning for me has been that the best work is often rooted in good relationships with clients. When the relationship is strong, so is the work. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why is diversity in the space important to you, and in general?Creativity is based on insights and life experiences. Without diversity, it means the creativity we offer as an industry is very limited, and we end up with work that doesn’t connect with the majority of the population because we’re drawing inspiration from such a small pool of insights. It’s not sustainable.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1706/399378-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Masango with his students from Blackboard," width="120" height="120">Gunning for creative diversity on Nkanyezi Masango's BlackboardNkanyezi Masango, now creative director at King James Group, is a true champion for excellence in creativity among youth.

This is so true in my case. Where I am in my career has to do with the amount of people who’ve believed in me and gave me a shot, such as Graham Lang and Alistair King. The only rule I’ve stuck to from day one is to work with people who I admire. I’ve never chased money, I chase great mentors. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the current state of advertising and what its future looks like to you.It’s an exciting time right now because everything is changing. Creatives can no longer choose between being in traditional or digital. As a creative, you need to understand every medium. So, I think in the near future, we won’t even say ‘digital copywriter’. It’s as ridiculous as saying ‘billboard copywriter’..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading for work?I’m currently reading Manage Your Money like a F#cking Grown Up.
