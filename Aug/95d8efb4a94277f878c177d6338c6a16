He said that while 2018 has been a tough year for retail, it's an industry with massive potential for growth. "We're moving away from blue-collar work to digital employment and I think it's important to ensure that we have a growing competitive digital economy," he said. "E-commerce is a shining light in the SA economy, and it's important that we recognise the success stories and the standout achievers in our unique industry."<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/455761.jpg" alt="Kevin Tucker" width="600" height="351">Kevin TuckerJudging processAfter a month-long public nomination process in June, the nominations were put to a vote.
