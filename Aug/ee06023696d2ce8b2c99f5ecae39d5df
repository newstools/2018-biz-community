So we see a lot of opportunity for exhibition industry growth in East Central Africa, which is only half a day’s travel from Europe.” Both Rwanda and Kenya are growing economies with business-friendly environments and first-world eventing facilities.Scan Display now has seven branches in Africa. This, combined with its extensive experience working across the continent, has positioned it as a leader in the African exhibition industry.Stead says, “Although we have a lot of experience working cross-border, we also recognise the many benefits of working from within a country, such as being able to make our stock more widely accessible, quickly, and being able to reduce costs for our clients. We also want to have a local presence so that we can actively help to grow and develop the exhibition industries in these markets.”The company is doing this through sharing resources and skills, and importing suitable product ranges – such as the Tension Fabric System (TFS). Justin Hawes, MD of Scan Display, says, “Fabric display systems have exploded in the international exhibition, event and retail space. TFS is our best-selling product. This is because it looks great, and it’s easy to use, reusable, cost-effective and transports well. This makes it a powerful display solution, and especially so for the African market.”Despite its many benefits, fabric systems like the TFS are not widely available in much of Africa. Scan Display Rwanda and Scan Display Kenya will be the first local suppliers of TFS in each country.Stead adds, “In both Rwanda and Kenya we are partnering with an established, knowledgeable local company that can help guide us in these markets.”For more information about Scan Display Rwanda and Scan Display Kenya, please contact Alastair Stead on alastair@scandisplay.co.zabRev('brev-7b064d6b-1dca-4b93-b9a3-06698e5b085e', '>a/\<az.oc.yalpsidnacs@riatsala>"az.oc.yalpsidnacs;46#&riatsala:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or +27 73 236 6618.For more information, please contact:Justin Hawes  | Scan Display Managing Director | justin@scandisplay.co.zabRev('brev-95ad68fb-0653-45a8-8139-e1ca1d9b4a26', '>a/\<az.oc.yalpsidnacs@nitsuj>"az.oc.yalpsidnacs;46#&nitsuj:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')  | +27 11 447 4777Visit: www.scandisplay.co.za |
