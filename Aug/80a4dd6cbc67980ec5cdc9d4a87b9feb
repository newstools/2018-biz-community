However, for the first time in many years, the income from fast food and take-away outlets have declined substantially during the first half of 2018, putting significant stress on the fast food industry. The saviour for the industry may potentially be the continued development of online food delivery services that have simplified access, and in the process, assisted in sustaining an industry that is experiencing increasing pressure.Insight Survey’s latest SA Fast Food Landscape Report 2018 uncovers the global and local fast food markets based on the latest information and research. It describes the market drivers and restraints as well as the relevant global and local market trends to present an objective insight into the South African fast food industry environment, market dynamics and its future. The global fast food market was valued at US$651bn in 2017 and is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 5.2% between 2018 and 2022. As illustrated in the graph below, certain key brands continue to dominate. In terms of brand value, McDonald’s is the largest global fast food brand in 2018 valued at US$126bn, followed by Starbucks and Subway valued at US$44.5bn and US$18.8bn, respectively.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/454293-625x395.png" alt="Source:  Graphics by Insight Survey" width="625" height="395">Source: Statista Graphics by Insight SurveyTechnological innovation will be one of the key drivers of growth for the fast food industry in the future. In South Africa, it has become particularly important for fast food franchises to ensure they have effective systems in place that enable consumers to order and buy online. A rapidly growing number of consumers are opting for the convenience of online delivery services when purchasing fast food. Currently, Mr D Food and UberEats are South Africa’s top two online ordering platforms. Mr D Food, which is owned by multinational Naspers, has a network of over 1,400 restaurants and delivers to over 1,900 suburbs in South Africa, while UberEats has a network of approximately 1,200 restaurants across Gauteng and Cape Town.Devin Sinclair, the CEO of Mr D Food, says that the company’s success has been strongly related to its ability to transform from a phone ordering business to an online ordering service. The transition has been particularly successful as the Mr D Foods mobile app has been downloaded over one million times and over R500m in orders were processed through the app in the last year. Mr D Foods also claims to have 270,000 active users per month and 2.6 deliveries per customer per month.UberEats, which operates in 100 cities in 27 countries, is another influential player in online food delivery services in South Africa. In October 2017, the food delivery app stated that it had surpassed over half a million downloads in its first year in South Africa. UberEats also introduced restaurant ratings, which allows consumers to see how users in their city have rated a specific restaurant. Despite the significant growth of online delivery in South Africa over the last few years, there is still the potential for more growth in the future. Larry Illg, Naspers Ventures CEO, says that food delivery in South Africa is still under-penetrated and will continue to show rapid growth in the future.
