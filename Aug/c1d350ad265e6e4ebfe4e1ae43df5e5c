Brands are able to go beyond content distribution and towards relationship building. In building a brand persona on social platforms we are able to leverage these platforms and their technology to build a relationship with our customers. At the very least, we can build the impression of a good relationship by leveraging social media. The currency of relationships is trustAt the heart of building relationship lies the currency of relationships – trust. Relationships are built on trust and destroyed when trust is broken. So, our role as a brand on social media is to build trust with our audience, which in turn leads to relationship building, brand love and advocacy. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452834-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Social media strategies beyond content plans: Apply the 80/20 rule" width="120" height="120">Social media strategies beyond content plans: Apply the 80/20 ruleBrands are chasing every single platform. Wanting to be everywhere, making sure that each platform has their voice, their content and their flavour...By Mike Saunders 13 Aug 2018There is a simple formula for trust, developed by Charles H. Green, which I have tested and applied to a number of consumer brand and B2B environments. Each time it helps to highlight the gaps in a social media strategy and what we need to focus on to build more trust. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/455332.jpg" alt="Social media strategies beyond content plans: Improve the trust equation" width="625" height="105">The four variablesCredibility has to do with the words we speak. In a sentence, we might say, “I can trust what she says about intellectual property; she’s very credible on the subject.”Reliability has to do with actions. We might say, “If he says he’ll deliver the product tomorrow, I trust him, because he’s dependable.”Intimacy refers to the safety or security that we feel when entrusting someone with something. We might say, “I can trust her with that information, she’s never violated my confidentiality before, and she would never embarrass me.”<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/453994-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Social media strategies beyond content plans: Nurture advocacy" width="120" height="120">Social media strategies beyond content plans: Nurture advocacyBuilding advocacy has always been a priority for brands in the past, and today is no different.

Identify the areas you can improve on and develop tactics to improve your score.
