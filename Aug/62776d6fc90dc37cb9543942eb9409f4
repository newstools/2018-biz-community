Just a week ago, SABC3 announced the winners of its’ latest presenter search. While the call was for only three, five hopefuls impressed the judges – Patience Stevens, DJ Fresh, Sbusiso Kumalo and Jeannie D – so much that they were announced as winners of permanent spots as presenters on SABC3.  <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/451722-120x120.jpg?2" alt="'Presenter Search on 3' judges Jeannie D, Sbusiso Kumalo, DJ Fresh and Patience Stevens." width="120" height="120">SABC 3's 'Presenter Search on 3' introduces five new faces to the channelSABC 3 has announced that it is welcoming five brand new faces to the channel as the fourth season of 'Presenter Search on 3' comes to an end...3 Aug 2018That’s Palesa Tembe, who joined Afternoon Express with Jeannie D and Bonnie Mbuli; Fezile Mkhize, Harmony Katulondi and Ryle De Morny, the self-dubbed league of extraordinary gentlemen now on the Top Billing rotation; and Thabiso Makhubela, on the super-early shift, presenting Expresso.But that’s not all. Fellow top-six contestant Mosa Kaiser was deemed such a talent that while she didn’t secure a permanent slot on SABC3’s flagship shows, she has also joined the Expresso show as a field reporter.Here, the ‘fantastic six’ explain why they applied for the audition process, what it was really like and how you can follow in their footsteps….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What motivated you to apply and what did you most and least enjoy? Tembe: I’ve always wanted to be a TV presenter, and I am no stranger to presenter searches, but SABC3 is a channel I've grown with. The channel has entertained me through the years and has been a big part of my life. When this opportunity of ‘Presenter Search on 3’, came along, I felt the stars had finally aligned perfectly. I had enough practice, and now I was ready to go for what I've always dreamed of. Mkhize: My girlfriend and friends thought the world needed to suffer, having to put up with me like they do. They thought I could take up the mantle and nudged me to try. Like many Africans, I’ve always loved the Top Billing show, so it didn’t take too much convincing.The experience on ‘Presenter Search on 3’ was phenomenal, because of how different it was to my usual job, so everything was amazing to me. The least enjoyable experience was waking up in the early hours while nursing a very bad cold for Expresso, but as soon as I stepped into the studio, I was on an incredible buzz.Katulondi: My friends and family. Top Billing has always been a dream of mine, and I wasn’t going to enter this year, but my friend asked me to enter with her. I was reluctant at first, but after more people kept asking me to enter, I did. I did it because there were a lot of people who believed in me.Once I noticed that, I realised how many people I could inspire and motivate to go for their dream by going for mine. There are many things I enjoyed in the competition, from the platform and opportunities to better my skills, to the new friends and family I made, to the adventures and travel destinations, and the love and support from everyone. But If I had to choose what I enjoyed the most, it would be seeing how inspired and motivated people were by me throughout this journey and how, when I won, the flame of encouragement was reignited in people to pursue their dreams. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452697.jpg" alt="This year's top ten finalists for the Presenter Search on 3." width="625" height="440">This year's top ten finalists for the Presenter Search on 3.The worst part is definitely be the eliminations. Knowing that someone’s journey and dreams could come to an end just like that. Not because they were bad, but because of a minor slip-up.De Morny: Through my sport and travels, I’ve been blessed enough to meet some incredible people and discover beautiful places and learn their stories. There’s just too many great lessons we can learn from others, especially those doing what they love and chasing their dreams.This role allows you to do that, and at the same time, it provides a bigger voice and platform to also share and facilitate some of the positive projects I’m involved in.I’ve begun to enjoy this more and more every day. I enjoy living in the moment, but with intent and purpose, I believe this role will always allow that.Makhubela: Growing up as a teenager, I always wanted to be a TV presenter but found myself landing on radio as a young adult, which simply masked my interest in TV presenting. Evidently, there was no avoiding it forever, as everyone I’ve worked with on corporate videos and whose events I MCed convinced me I needed to do it. I really enjoyed being pushed with every challenge to find my flow as a TV host. One of the highlights for me was the takeover challenge with the Expresso Show. In that time, I got to really live out a dream and get a glimpse of what work as a TV presenter would look and feel like. What I least enjoyed was eliminations. Everyone in the competition was good, so seeing someone go each week with whom I'd built a connection was never nice.Kaiser: I applied to get back into TV and try TV presenting, because I already do radio. I enjoyed every challenge but didn’t enjoy the eliminations..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to from your new role? Tembe: I'm most looking forward to meeting incredible guests and hearing life-changing stories. I'm also looking forward to growing as a presenter, and as a woman.Mkhize: Engaging with people and allowing them to tell their stories. Top Billing is a lifestyle show, and its foundation is finding stories that inspire and help the viewers – everything I love to do. Finding the humanity in a story is what keeps this all so invigorating.Katulondi: I'm looking forward to the opportunities the most. The opportunities to meet people and tell their stories, the travel, the food, the adventures. But most of all, the opportunity to constantly be a beacon of hope and an example that prayers work and dreams do come true!De Morny: There are so many opportunities this role provides. It allows you to discover. I can’t wait to learn, explore and travel beautiful parts of our country and the world’s culture, and hopefully experience some adventure, too.Above that, I get to share that experience with others. I also get to meet boundary-pushers and showcase other people’s talents, allowing them an opportunity to share their passion with others.Makhubela: Expresso is a brilliant show to get South Africans waking up and charged up for the day. I’m looking forward to delivering great "charge-you-up" TV, which connects us with our viewers. I’m also looking forward to growing in a space with such talented people as the ones who work on Expresso.  Kaiser: I’m looking forward to being both in front of and behind the camera..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who are the industry mentors you most look up to? Tembe: Obvious mentors I've looked up to are, of course, Jeannie D and Bonnie Mbuli, and meeting them was a dream come true as one of the main reasons I wanted to win Afternoon Express was to work with them. I've asked them both to help me navigate my way, not only on the show but also in the entertainment industry in general. Pabi Moloi is another favourite of mine. Her strength and consistency in the industry is something I've always admired.Mkhize: I have a long list of people I think of as inspiration: Jonathan Boynton-Lee, Bonnie Mbuli, Jeannie D and Tumi Morake, to name a few. I also have great respect for figures like Maps Maponyane and Jesse Suntele, as they’re within my age group and making waves in the industry, which has allowed for the doors to open for us all.Katulondi: My mentors aren't necessarily industry-related, they actually transcend through industries and slay while doing it. They're thinkers, creative and not limited. They're dynamic and still give back. TD Jakes, Basetsana Kumalo, DJ Fresh, Oprah, Jay Z, Pharrell Williams, Diddy, Barack Obama, Nelson Mandela, PS Ray McCauley.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/449305-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Mandela100: 'We have no choice but to move forward' - Obama" width="120" height="120">#Mandela100: 'We have no choice but to move forward' - Obama"Let me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision, I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King..."18 Jul 2018De Morny: I look up to anyone living out their dream, chasing their heart’s stimulations and running towards life’s boundaries, as long as it’s real. Keep watching this space to meet them!Makhubela: Patience Stevens, who is my executive producer is the doyenne of TV-making. She gives such wholesome guidance and has seen the television industry evolve. She has an incredible understanding of viewers, and is always a step ahead of the game when it comes to what the next great thing is for TV. I’m also inspired by hosts like Bonnie Mbuli. She has mastered the ability to be so authentic in a space that has seen many sway away from their true selves in the quest for fame and popularity. Kaiser: I look up to Bonang Matheba! I’m inspired by her work ethic..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Now that you’re in the spotlight, share a few tips for youngsters looking to follow in your footsteps.Tembe: Invest in your dreams and craft. Study your skill in theory and in practice. Don’t take it for granted that in entertainment, you can walk in and find your way blindly. With prayer, God's blessings and preparation, nothing can stop you.Mkhize: Haha! I still have to come to terms with this spotlight thing. My advice is to never forget that kindness is the best currency. It doesn’t mean people will respond in kind, but deciding to always temper your engagement with kindness means you dictate how your life will be lived and hopefully change or make someone’s day.It’s nice to be important, but it’s more important to be nice.Katulondi: It's possible for you! You need to believe that it's possible, do your best and leave the rest to God. You've got to work towards it like it's possible, because it is. Then you've got to be persistent, no matter what happens. It may be a hard road, but keep going. Keep going, keep pushing, keep praying and keep humble, your time is coming.De Morny: Wow! Great question! You must genuinely follow and chase after your loves, don’t comprise on that. Now more than ever, I believe you can materialise your dreams, just keep doing you! Stay genuine and true. You are beautifully unique, so be the best version of that. It would be selfish to deny yourself and others that.Makhubela: I have three words: Passion, drive and patience. Let your passion fuel you. This will be the only thing that keeps you going when things don't go your way. Your drive will prepare you to pursue opportunities that even you might sometimes think are unlikely for you. Lastly, patience! Things always seem to go slow when you're hungry and yearning for that breakthrough but, if you practice patience, you'll find that you deal better with the pace of things.Kaiser: Always follow your dreams, stand up for what you believe in, don’t let anyone walk over you and trust your journey.Simple as that!
