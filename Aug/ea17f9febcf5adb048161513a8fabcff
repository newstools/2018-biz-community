The intelligent way to re-engage customers and prospective clients? The great way to maximise on your current advertising spend? Are you remarketing yet?By JG Bezuidenhout 14 Aug 2018If it’s missing from your strategy, and you haven’t tried remarketing yet, you’ll be doing your competitors a favour when they scoop up all the opportunities that could have been yours. Not to mention the missed opportunities to maximise on your current advertising spend and re-engage customers and prospective clients.How exactly can remarketing help my business?With remarketing you can serve up an ad tailored to a potential customer or “lost user” (a consumer who visited your site but didn’t make a purchase), with something you know they have already shown an interest in. It allows you to reconnect with consumers when they have more time to think about your offer, at specific times of day, when they are spending time on Facebook or Instagram, or even when they are nearer to your store. My remarketing clients have reported an improved ROI (return on investment) of up to 60% on their current lost users. Remarketing ensures you, and your brand, are there when the customer is ready to buy and thus preventing your competitors from intercepting the sale.Remarketing in action: The story of Joe’s PlumbingStill not convinced? Not sure how remarketing could be applicable in your business? How about a practical description of remarketing in action? I'd like to use the story of Joe’s Plumbing:You know you have a leaking tap at home and you need a plumber. During your day at work you Google “plumbers in my area”. A Joe’s Plumbing Google ad comes up as the first result and you click on it (You should know Joe paid Google for that click). Just as the website opens, you get distracted: your phone is ringing and you’re now late for an important meeting. Plumbing needs will have to wait - you leave the tab open on your browser with every intention of calling Joe when you get back to your desk.You’re back at your desk but your day hasn’t got any calmer. In a flurry of online activity, while busy with emails, you accidentally close the tab. Not the end of the world, you tell yourself, you can just find it again later.It’s later now and you are back at home, scrolling through Facebook. And guess what pops up in your feed? An ad for Joe’s Plumbing! It says: “Still looking for a plumber, why not book a callout on our website now!” And that’s what you do, the reminder comes at the perfect time (plus if you listen carefully you can actually hear the leaking tap in the other room), and you book a call out.Without the well-timed remarketing ad there is a chance the customer in the story may have ended up forgetting to search Joe’s Plumbing by name, and ended up giving the business to another local plumber.This same, simple principle could be applied to any businesses that advertise online - the real moral of the story is, that if you are not using remarketing in your digital marketing mix, you are missing opportunities and your competitors will probably thank you for it.
