As a woman, I consider it a privilege to be able to use my own experiences and that of my esteemed peers to invest in, and to inspire other young women coming up in the industry to unleash their own power of creativity and to aim for those Golds and Grand Prix awards.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1608/356861.jpg" alt="Suhana Gordhan appointed chairperson of the Loeries" width="120" height="120">Suhana Gordhan appointed chairperson of the LoeriesSuhana Gordhan, creative director at FCB Africa, has been named the Loeries' newest chairperson.

The industry faces so many challenges, but The Loeries is a fantastic organisation in that it continues to cherish and celebrate one simple thing – and that is the undeniable value of creativity. Our job is to recognise, reward, inspire and foster creative excellence so those four doors open up numerous opportunities to bring real change. The chairperson platform gives you the space to tackle if you choose, the issues that stand in the way of protecting our creative currency. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/407676-120x120.jpg?2" alt="All images: FCB graduates Papi Raborife and NJ Minyuku followed Gordhan around during Loeries 2017 weekend to document the event." width="120" height="120">#LadiesofLoeries: Chair aunty Suhana Gordhan on the mayhem and magicSuhana Gordhan does a lot in a day, from putting up with mansplaining to switching focus from her day job as CD at FCB to meeting her responsibilities as Loeries chair. She lets us in on what life was like for her over Loeries weekend 2017...By Leigh Andrews 25 Aug 2017When I took up the role as chair aunty, I never knew how much value it would bring to my life. I have learned so much about myself – about stepping into my own power and finding my own voice. Mostly, I have seen that there are so many people with a spirit of generosity – people that will share your passion and help propel you forward when you’re fighting for the right things. This collective energy helps to silence the naysayers and move the immovable ones. At one stage, things got too difficult and I wanted to quit but a colleague and friend, sat me down over dinner and said, “No! You cannot quit.” He said, “Do you realise how important it is not just for someone of colour like me, but for all of us to see you in this role? It gives us all hope.” I’m sad to say goodbye as chairperson, but I’m excited for the new chair to bring their energy to the game. Also, while I will no longer be the chairperson, something tells me that I will always enjoy being an 'aunty' in the industry. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That's so good to hear. It’s a year since the launch of Open Chair, what stands out when you think back to August 2017? How has Open Chair grown since then? August 2017 was such a highlight in that Open Chair was launched. It was a special event because I saw that many of the issues that plague women of my generation are not the same issues that trouble these young women.I saw a future of bright, charismatic and ambitious young women who are focused and interested in growing and getting to the top of their game. It was hugely inspiring and something that I know we desperately need to do more of.I’m very sad to say that it’s been a bit of a challenge to keep Open Chair alive this year due to a few issues, mainly sponsorship. But we are working on some plans. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1708/405763-120x120.jpg?4" alt="#Loeries2017: Open Chair starts a movement amongst women in advertising" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2017: Open Chair starts a movement amongst women in advertisingOn the eve of Women's Day, women in advertising gathered to start a conversation that will hopefully inspire generations to come...By Jessica Tennant 10 Aug 2017Open Chair is still our very precious baby and very much close to my heart. We will find a way to make it thrive..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Amazing. Have you noticed there’s more openness to share experiences and learning curves amongst female creatives this year, especially with the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements? I definitely feel that the consciousness and the conversation is growing. I see more and more women reaching out – either to ask for mentorship or to share their own knowledge and experiences. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1705/391689-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Fighting sexism: ‘I love giving blow jobs to sandwiches’, says this model in the #WomenNotObjects campaign in the US.

But I believe that we need to have more and more of these conversations and we need men to join in, too. In South Africa, we have a more complex scenario in that our transformation story is also very much rooted in race dynamics. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1808/452899-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Onilude and Opoku at the 2018 Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity." width="120" height="120">Wave goodbye to 'pale, stale, male' industry events with WiM AfricaWomen in Marketing (WiM) Africa launches through their Loeries Masterclass today.

My response to this is: Why can’t we do both? We are not truly transformed until our industry voices are more black and black female..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Definitely. Let’s end with a discussion on mentors and their role in your own life…Before, I never had an official mentor myself, those things were just not available to us growing up in the industry. It was sink or swim. But now, I’ve found a collection of people that I go to when I need wisdom and guidance. These are some of my leaders at FCB and some family members. I’ve also invested in a life coach. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/447668-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Think Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi." width="120" height="120">#Mandela100: The Madiba magic of mentoringThink Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi explain the importance of being both a mentor and mentee...By Leigh Andrews 5 Jul 2018All these people know me well and have my best interests at heart.
