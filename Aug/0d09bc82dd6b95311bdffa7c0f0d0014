Through Edelman, I have been so fortunate to have worked on such iconic brands doing amazing work aimed at changing and positively impacting the lives of millions. Such brands include The Rockefeller Foundation that supports work that expands opportunity and strengthens resilience to social, economic, health and environmental challenges. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1712/422903.jpg" alt="Uplifting youth employment with DDT" width="120" height="120">Uplifting youth employment with DDTFollowing the launch of the Demand-Driven Training Toolkit by the Rockefeller Foundation in South Africa recently, we chatted to the company's Africa Regional Office MD, Mamadou Biteye about DDT and how it will alleviate youth unemployment...By Shan Radcliffe 23 Nov 2017The Elders, an independent group of global leaders such as Richard Branson and Graca Machel, who are working together for peace and human rights.

Women own PR and marketing agencies, there is representation of females in executive levels. It’s all about hard work.The only real challenge in this industry is about remaining relevant. Things are changing at such a rapid pace such that what is in today, may not be in tomorrow. And to stay on the cutting edge, you have to keep up or you will work yourself out of a job..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who’s your female role models/business mentors – women you respect and admire?My mother. As a working woman all her life and a business owner, I learned all the fundamentals of hard work, perseverance and understanding that things will not be given to you on a silver platter – you have to work for them.Thuli Madonsela: Having the courage to do what is right when all odds are stacked up against you is something that is not easy to accomplish. Thuli Madonsela truly inspired me whilst she was the Public Protector. I do not think that it was an easy feat for her, she sacrificed so much for the greater good.Dr Judi Dlamini: As a pioneer in many aspects, I have learned through Dr Dlamini’s example that I can be a career woman and still have a family. She has achieved such amazing things and continues to do so. Through her example I am encouraged to reach for all of my dreams, the only limits are the ones that I set for myself.Dr Esther Mahlangu: She has been honoured for being authentic. I don’t know anyone that is as real as this woman. She makes me so proud to be part of a country that is so unique and rich in its diversity that is matched by no other nation. Her example reminds me constantly that African beauty is something to be proud of.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1803/432073-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Edelman Trust Barometer shows drop in trust in SA" width="120" height="120">Edelman Trust Barometer shows drop in trust in SAThe 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer revealed that while only 14 percent of the general population trusts the government, 77 percent believe that chief executive officers should take the lead on change rather than waiting for the government to impose it...6 Mar 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}This Women’s Month, what is your word of encouragement to aspiring women in business?Many women have made sacrifices for us to be here today to speak and live freely. Let’s not allow their sacrifices to have been in vain. We need to remember them and why they fought so hard for women to have equal representation in society. We all have a role to play and charity begins at home. We need to find that contribution we are here to make and make it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What's next for you?The plight of women in South Africa is alarmingly bad. We do not believe enough in ourselves and we need to support each other. We need to love ourselves and each other more so that we will not tolerate violence and abuse against women. I want to inspire and encourage other women who are struggling to realise their purpose to come out of their shells and not be shy about their dreams. It is our time now.I will be participating in a series of speaking opportunities in previously disadvantaged communities and education institutions focusing on empowering women and helping them to realise the potential in them to be great. It is my turn to pay it forward.For updates on these events and more, follow Ntsinde on Twitter and Facebook.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
