The long nights, the fights, the high-stress situations all dissolve away when your name is called.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1802/428406-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scenes from the #2minuteshowersongs and #weewiser campaigns." width="120" height="120">Campaigning to #DefeatDayZeroThe phrases 'water crisis', 'drought' and 'day zero' have been taking up headline space consistently for the past few months. While this has set most of the country into a frenzy, Cape Town-based creatives put their (shower) thinking caps on, with ways to better educate the public and hopefully #DefeatDayZero...By Leigh Andrews 8 Feb 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why do you think this campaign was deserving of such a win?Good work, by its nature, grips the viewer's imagination and sells them on an idea they haven’t necessarily thought of. This campaign had it all: celebs, music, and the anxiety of a massive threat that was starting to engulf the existence of all of us living in Cape Town. Emotions were high and we used those emotions positively..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about the thinking behind the idea?Capetonians were getting a bit tired of the hostile way in which we were being told to not exceed our shower limit. So, we decided to make a positive contribution by reframing how those two minutes should feel. The team decided to essentially create a musical two-minute egg timer by recreating songs our audience were already very familiar with. Hearing those songs played in a way that they had never heard them was just what our audience needed. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Which Loeries win(s) did you personally feel to be most deserving, and why?King James does work that wins awards, not work to win awards. There’s a difference. Every piece of work we do is to help solve a client’s need, so when a piece of work is awarded something after the fact, it’s always deeply satisfying. It always makes the job feel more worthwhile, regardless of how hard it was to create, or what circumstances made it challenging to see through..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the current creative landscape in South Africa and how this compares globally?Our industry is in a state of flux right now, particularly overseas. There’s a lot of jostling for corporate position which I frankly would rather stay out of. Here in South Africa we still love the idea, perhaps naively, that there are many marketers who still value a great creative idea above all else, and as long as we stick to that belief our work will continue to be interesting and worth engaging with..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next?Everything is next. Advertising is like a perpetual rolling wave of endless creative opportunity.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1501/250697-120x120.jpg" alt="#BehindtheSelfie with...
