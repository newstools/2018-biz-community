While she calls her career one of the highlights of her life, she acknowledges that not everyone is as lucky to work in a supportive, collaborative environment.That said, women cannot wait for companies to champion change. Here, Wise shares the choices she’s made along the way that led to her current work-life happiness, as well as her views on the fact that nurturing and enabling women is a conscious and consistent imperative for anyone in a leadership position….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Let’s start with a brief overview of your career highlights within the B2B space. My career is one of the highlights in my life. I have worked with and managed really great people over the last 14 years, and the business-to-business (B2B) space has by far been the most exciting. Being a part of an entrepreneurial-led business has taught me a fortune. I’ve been lucky enough to be part of the growth of Demographica, and its pivot from a small email and SMS business to a full-service B2B specialist agency. In that time, I’ve had multiple roles and embraced the change from sales to client service to managing people and teams. I have onboarded, managed and grown Demographica’s biggest accounts and grown our client service team to include experienced, talented men and women.<img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1807/447841-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The importance of diversity when creating communications strategies" width="120" height="120">The importance of diversity when creating communications strategiesIt's becoming commonly known that what's fundamentally missing from the brand strategy process is the diversity of the talent. Warren Moss elaborates on why diversity is an important aspect when creating communication strategies...By Warren Moss 5 Jul 2018I’m grateful to be a part of this advertising agency championing B2B as a focus in SA. Winning multiple pitches against big, internationally owned agencies will always be a thrill I chase and because Demographica is poised for high growth, I know we’ll be celebrating often..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Fantastic. Switching from a celebratory mindset to one of concern, comment on female representation in management positions within the B2B space and the personal steps you’ve taken to correct the situation.From where I sit, it’s definitely not sufficient. My feeling is that women can’t wait for companies to champion change or for leaders to genuinely respect and understand the meaningful contributions we make. Instead, here are some choices I’ve made that helped me get to management and executive level in my career:I chose a husband who loves my drive, boasts about my career and supports me every step of the way. Pick a person that supports your career.I work for a company and a boss that shares my values, drives inclusiveness and sees the value in me. Pick a company that supports both motherhood and your career.I tell my kids about my work, why I love it and that it makes me happy. My girls must know that it’s important to be dedicated to the pursuit of their dreams and put the time in to achieve it. Share your work experiences with your family.I accept the fact that I can’t always balance home and career. Some days I manage like a pro and other days, not so much. I love what New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern says about this:Working women can have it all when it comes to family, children and a career, but they can't do it alone.I embrace both the ‘typical’ male and female attributes in myself. What I mean is, I can be tough, confident and have a strong opinion, whilst separating emotional and rational approaches to problem-solving. I also realise that empathy and nurturing is vital at work, and that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That alone is powerful. Why is mentorship of young females in the B2B space so important?Nurturing and enabling women is a conscious and consistent imperative for anyone in a leadership position. Nurturing young women through their careers breeds self-confidence and self-awareness, shows them their areas for growth, and speeds up their acknowledgment of their own worth. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1505/282218-120x120.jpg" alt="People: The heart of Demographica's direct communications" width="120" height="120">People: The heart of Demographica's direct communicationsDemographica CEO Warren Moss on 'The Demographica Way', the full-time anthropologists they employ and the importance of people in targeting direct communications...By Leigh Andrews 28 May 2015Enabling women by creating a space for honest conversations and input ensures your business has a team of accountable, A-team players, who contribute meaningfully to your business and to their families. It’s a win-win.I read somewhere that: “remarkable business leadership starts with someone else’s vision for you.” I love this! How incredible would the workplace be if we could all focus on someone else’s growth, as well as our own?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Sounds ideal. Who are your personal female business mentors and why? I’m lucky to be surrounded by male and female mentors in my work. I learn from my incredible Exco team and I learn from people that report to me. I’m inspired by the women in my family who run their own businesses, have careers spanning decades, work hard and love what they do. <img src="http://biz-file.com/c/1804/435588-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Newsmaker: Getting to really know Demographica's new GM Lauren Damant" width="120" height="120">#Newsmaker: Getting to really know Demographica's new GM Lauren DamantNamed one of the most influential women in SA digital marketing in 2016 by Memeburn and Ventureburn, Damant is respected in the industry and has the required experience and expertise to help drive growth....By Jessica Tennant 5 Apr 2018I love Sheryl Sandberg and her book, Lean in. We should read this paragraph every Sunday:Fear is the root of so many of the barriers that woman face. Fear of not being liked. Fear of making the wrong decision. Fear of drawing negative attention. Fear of overachieving. Fear of being judged. Fear of failure. And the holy trinity of fear: the fear of being a bad mother/wife/daughter..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Quite the holy trinity. Let’s end with a few tips for young females looking to follow in your fearless footsteps. I’ve always loved where I’ve worked. I have, in my career, chosen to commit to a company, worked hard, proved myself in multiple roles and move into leadership. I made it my mission to find a good place to climb. The great advice that I wish I had listened to earlier in my career, was to upskill and grow myself:Find the time to read, listen and network. Start today.Speak up, don’t avoid conflict. Back yourself and be prepared.There is no problem at work that can’t wait an hour – family comes first.Put the time in and put your hand up. Work hard and don’t expect great opportunities to come to you.Apply humility to your work.Be kind.Truly wise words.
