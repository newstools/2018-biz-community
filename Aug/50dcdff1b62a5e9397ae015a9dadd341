This year Subaru took its commitment to adventure to greater elevations when it used the SUV range in the production of its latest television commercial. Film production took place in parts of South Africa that only the truly adventurous dare to go. The vehicles, crew and the PYGA Euro Steel team were challenged day and night to traverse to remote locations to capture the team in a variety of breathtaking South African panoramas. “Mountain biking is one of the few sports where the vehicle has to be as active as the participants,” says Nteo Nkoli, Marketing Specialist for Subaru Southern Africa. The commercial made use of the Subaru SUV range to transport and then film the PYGA team doing what they do best – trailblazing remote mountain peaks, traversing rivers and forests and conquering rugged canyons. “We drove to five different locations, travelling a total of 1,100 kilometres in just five days. It was gruelling stuff,” Nkoli added.
