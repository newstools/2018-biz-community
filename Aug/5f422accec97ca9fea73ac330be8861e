My gut is telling me that the live events may be the more innovative and exciting part of the judging as PR seems to have gone into quite a functional space this past year. Perhaps this has been because of the incredible amount of crisis and brand trust issues that have arisen as marketers, and agencies have struggled with corporate governance, fake news, global campaigns not translating well to local environments. It doesn’t seem as if it has been a fun time in the PR space, but I am hoping that there are some clever cut-through creative entries. As always, I’m looking forward to seeing the Middle East and African entries..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Outside your category, what are your general expectations for the quality of this year’s entries.The Cannes winners were a good indication of creativity in our region being alive and well.

I’ve actually broken it down as a case study for a client: on how flexible and fluid the campaign was (she only got her name hours before launch), to how it actually shone a light back on the client for not putting their money where their mouth was regarding gender diversity (they actually got fined) and how social activism and community support took what was essentially a short-term PR stunt and, a year later, Fearless Girl has morphed into many different messages whilst still standing.
