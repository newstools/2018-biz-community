Singh previously partnered with the Panorama Global team on Remember which was co-produced by Detalle Films, Distant Horizon and Serendipity Point Films.Singh praises Alonso RuizpalaciosMuseo is loosely based upon true events and follows two veterinary school drop-outs who find that they are in way over-their-heads when they commit Mexico’s most improbable heist – the looting of its sacred Anthropology Museum – but the invaluable treasure quickly turns into an inescapable and ruinous curse that is impossible to fence.Commenting on the Berlin selection, Singh said, “We are honoured that Museo has been invited to participate in the prestigious official competition of the Berlin International Film Festival in February, being one of only 24 films which are selected for the official competition from hundreds of films submitted. Director, Alonso Ruizpalacios has crafted an exceptional film and is one of the most exciting directors I have worked with.”Museo is the first film to secure permission to shoot in Mexico’s National Anthropology Museum and at the Mayan ruins of Palenque, a Unesco World Heritage Site. The production did a magnificent job recreating the interior of the Aztec, Mayan and Zapotec exhibit rooms of the Museum as they were in 1985, the year in which the story is set.
