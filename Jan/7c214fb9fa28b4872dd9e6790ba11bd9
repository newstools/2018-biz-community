Furthermore, the venture will speed up the delivery of the much-anticipated next generation of OZblu blueberries.“This is good news for the entire blueberry category. We strongly believe that if the whole blueberry industry can elevate the consumer eating experience with new varieties of this superfood, it will lead to a transformative uplift and broader consumption for the entire blueberry industry and drive future growth,” explains Roger Horak, global CEO and founder of United Exports and co-founder of OZblu. “Too often customers will buy blueberries and be disappointed with them. We have worked hard to create and develop blueberries that are firm, sweet and crunchy, which is how they should taste,” says Dave Mazzardis, the breeder of the OZblu varieties. “Migiva Group’s innovative spirit and focus on delivering a superior consumer experience through specialty varieties and best farming practices, and OZblu’s outstanding consumer-oriented blueberry breeding programme provides a perfect match,” explains Jonathan Geller of Migiva Group.
