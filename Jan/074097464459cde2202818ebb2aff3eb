A new wave of companies aims to provide consumers with genetic findings related to their general health, fitness and nutrition, with the market growth being global and competition in the largely unregulated Chinese market particularly intense.“The consumer market still faces hurdles, such as country-specific regulations. Companies will need to be clear and upfront with consumers about the limitations of findings, or risk losing their trust” states report author Alison Angus, Euromonitor International’s head of lifestyles. “However, things are improving on the regulatory front and with the market continuing to evolve; it is likely that further innovative start-ups will invest in new technologies.” AR improves customer experienceWith Augmented Reality (AR) having a wide range of applications in various industries, the potential in the mainstream consumer space is vast, bringing the benefits of in-store shopping into the home. Euromonitor International forecasts that global internet retailing value sales will increase by a further 3 percent in 2018. “Augmented Reality improves the consumer experience, providing a more lifelike view of the items and facilitates operational efficiencies for businesses by potentially reducing return rates” comments Angus. “Online captures consumers’ interest with the convenience of the hassle-free, anytime, anywhere shopping they crave. The ability to see and touch products before buying is a bonus. This is in part why the in-store shopping experience remains appealing, and in 2017, 88 percent of global sales in value terms were still made in-store,” she adds.
