The Shape Of WaterFrom the inspired mindscape of the master storyteller and visionary Guillermo del Toro – who gave us Pan’s Labyrinth, Cronos, and The Devil’s Backbone – comes another astounding and mind-blowing cinematic experience: The Shape Of Water. Del Toro casts an other-worldly spell with The Shape Of Water, merging the pathos and thrills of the classic monster movie tradition with shadowy film noir, then stirring in the heat of a love story like no other to explore the fantasies we all flirt with, the mysteries we can’t control and the monstrosities we must confront.This other-worldly fairy tale is set against the backdrop of Cold War-era America circa 1962 where a lonely lab assistant (Sally Hawkins) is trapped in a life of isolation in the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, until the day her life changes forever when she discovers a secret classified experiment: a mysterious, scaled creature from South America that lives in a water tank. This mystery-shrouded amphibious being has not only been hauled up from the dark, watery depths but seems to have the fundamental adaptive qualities of water – taking on the psychic contours of every human he encounters, reflecting back both aggression and fathomless love.BreatheProducer Jonathan Cavendish had always believed that his father’s life story would be powerful material for a compelling film.

Together they refuse to be imprisoned by his suffering; dazzling others with their humour, courage and lust for life.Megan LeaveyThe true-life story of Megan Leavey, a young Marine corporal whose unique discipline and bond with a military combat dog saved many lives during her deployment in Iraq.
