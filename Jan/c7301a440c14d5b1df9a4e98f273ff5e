But they lack the necessary funding. We think the Partech Africa fund will make an important contribution to closing this funding gap and driving entrepreneurship and growth.”Partech Africa is also backed by corporate investors such as mobile operator Orange and leading emerging markets players such as Edenred and JCDecaux.“As a leading enabler of the African tech Industry, Orange is strongly pushing for next Pan-African digital champions to emerge and grow. Our commitment to Partech Africa is a critical component of our larger Orange Digital Ventures Africa initiative which aims to accelerate the growth and scalability of innovative tech-enabled businesses,” said Pierre Louette, deputy CEO of Orange and chairman of Orange Digital Investment.This article was originally published on www.disrupt-africa.com.
