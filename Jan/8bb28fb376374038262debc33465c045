The opportunity to be able to finally tell these brands’ stories is exciting because all eyes are on Zimbabwe at the moment, and telling a brand’s story is ultimately telling the story of a country, my country. We, as a company, look forward to being a part of the country’s positive narrative.”Already managing a key account in Zimbabwe, Content Candy is gearing up to open shop across the border. “We have a strong team with a diverse skill set that is able to serve all content needs for any brand, says Nyakudya-Dandala. “And as a Certified Hubspot Partner, Content Candy has the proven experience and expertise to strategise a project and see it through from conceptualisation to conclusion, in any medium. Our goal is to continuously provide added value to every brand story at competitive rates.“Africa, as a whole, is in a phase of positive disruption. It’s an exciting time for the media and marketing industry and we look forward to new opportunities in Zimbabwe,” concludes Nyakudya-Dandala.Content Candy currently has offices in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and soon Harare.
