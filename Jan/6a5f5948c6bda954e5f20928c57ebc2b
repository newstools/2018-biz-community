From dairy farms to Eskom, the Guptas seem to be involved in it all. And once Zuma officially steps away from the protection the Presidency has offered him all these years, the Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that prosecutors will be allowed bring back 783 counts of corruption against him relating to a 1999 arms deal. Although we may not see any of these faces actually appear in a courtroom on charges this year, inquiries and investigations into Zuma and the Guptas will definitely be on the legal watchlist in 2018 and beyond.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426468.jpg" alt="Why it's taken so long to prosecute state capture cases in South Africa" width="120" height="120">Why it's taken so long to prosecute state capture cases in South AfricaThe Asset Forfeiture Unit of South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that it is probing seven cases related to what has come to be known as "state capture", involving R50bn...24 Jan 2018Oscar, againThe court proceedings against former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, captured such vast attention in 2014 that the trial got its own TV channel. Originally charged with culpable homicide, Pistorius received five years and was release on house arrest after just 10 months. The State appealed the judgement and the Supreme Court of Appeal responded with a murder conviction and a six year sentence. Another State petition later, challenging what it called a "lenient sentence", and the SCA upped Pistorius' time from six to 13 years. In December last year, Pistorius filed with the Constitutional Court, appealing the new sentence.

Van Breda has testified that an unknown assailant wearing gloves and a balaclava is responsible for the deadly attack on his family. During the 63-day trial, the court heard the accused's recorded call to emergency services (which came hours after the attack), state prosecutor Susan Galloway threw a spotlight on contradictions between his testimony and the evidence, there was a trial-within-a-trial as the defence complained that Van Breda had been treated as nothing but a suspect from the start, and Van Breda received a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Following the conclusion of the defence's case on 29 November last year, presiding Judge Siraj Desai postponed the case, stating that closing arguments will be heard on 12 February 2018.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1706/398743.jpg" alt="New ruling puts court trials in the spotlight" width="120" height="120">New ruling puts court trials in the spotlightOn 21 June 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal handed down a judgment allowing video recording of a trial.

During the court hearings, it emerged that Jason had been having an affair with a colleague who was attending the conference. Susan was painted by the defence as jealous and volatile, having insisted on attending the weekend-long event to keep an eye on her husband. They'd been seen arguing just a few hours before her body was found in the bathroom with an electrical cord from a hair styling tool around her neck and door hanger. The defence claims she was emotionally unstable and she commited suicide. The prosecution, however, believes the scene was staged, and that she died from manual strangulation at the hands of husband. The case was postponed on 5 December and will continue on 5 February.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1711/417849.jpg" alt="WhatsApp evidence reveals Rohdes' bitter love betrayal" width="120" height="120">WhatsApp evidence reveals Rohdes' bitter love betrayalWhatsApp exchanges between murder-accused Jason Rohde, his late wife Susan and his mistress Jolene Alterskye were read out in court Monday, 6 November 2017, revealing vicious fights in the days before her death...By Aron Hyman 7 Nov 2017Captain KGBCaptain Morris ‘KGB’ Tshabalala, a crime intelligence officer, was arrested while checking in with his parole officer in Pretoria central earlier this month.
