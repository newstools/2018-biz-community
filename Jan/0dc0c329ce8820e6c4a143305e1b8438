He also admitted that he knew he was not acting on the instructions of Premier Mahumapelo and that his actions were unlawful,” said the Office of the Premier.Meanwhile, the Premier Mahumapelo welcomed the sentence.“This must be a lesson to the accused that crime does not pay. I am happy that the law has taken its course,” said Premier Mahumapelo.Hengary was arrested by the Hawks in December 2016 near Kuruman after he had impersonated Mahumapelo while committing fraud.In some instances, he concocted stories to extract money from people pretending to be acting under the instruction of the Premier.
