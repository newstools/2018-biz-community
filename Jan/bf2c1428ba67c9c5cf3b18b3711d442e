Trump, Jr. had access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks.4.   TIME FALSELY reported that President Trump removed a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office.5.   Washington Post FALSELY reported the President’s massive sold-out rally in Pensacola, Florida was empty. Dishonest reporter showed picture of empty arena HOURS before crowd started pouring in.6.   CNN FALSELY edited a video to make it appear President Trump defiantly overfed fish during a visit with the Japanese prime minister. Japanese prime minister actually led the way with the feeding.7.   CNN FALSELY reported about Anthony Scaramucci’s meeting with a Russian, but retracted it due to a “significant breakdown in process.”8.
