Both courses draw submissions from professionals already working in media, public relations, as well as students and those working to promote the arts.  However, because both courses are intense and hands-on, providing direct access to lecturers and close encounters with some of the artists performing at the CTIJF, places are limited. Applications close on 15 February 2018 and those looking for a way to advance their skills and careers, are urged to apply sooner rather than later.To apply, go to:  Arts Journalism Online Application FormPhotojournalism Online Application FormCapturing and preserving performancesBilly Domingo, Festival Director of the CTIJF, said: “The Training and Development programmes of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival have always been an integral part of why this festival was created. Our desire has always been to build a robust foundation to promote new artists, capture the heritage of established performers and provide opportunities for those looking to establish a career in the entertainment arena (either front of house or behind the scenes), to get hands-on practical experience. It’s invaluable.“But, although we can grow tomorrow’s artists through giving them a place to perform and reach new audiences, without having these performances and musical narratives captured for posterity and giving them the ability to reach and influence even more people, what’s the point?  That’s why a strong contingent of modern day ‘data capturers’ is essential to the survival of the music, arts and cultural industry – worldwide – and why these courses continue to grow in relevance and importance.” Course leadsAward-winning music aficionada, author and radio presenter, Percy Mabandu will lead the Arts Journalism course, with arts and culture writer and journalist Gwen Ansell joining Mabandu to give voice to the Arts Journalism Public Debate – this year’s topic is set to provoke some strong responses. Another graduate of both the Arts Journalism and Mentoring Arts Journalism programmes, is Caroline Mwangi, who will lead the CTIJF Photojournalism workshop for the third year. Caroline is a respected photographer and writer who has had several gallery exhibitions at home and abroad. She brings with her a thorough understanding of the medium and today’s working environment and needs. Because ‘content’ is the order of the day, this year’s course will see a closer working relationship and collaboration with the Arts Journalism students to consolidate the bond between words and images – both stills and video.  Students, who have their own equipment and will already have mastered the basics of photography, will learn how to develop a signature approach to crafting images and ones that tell a story. They will be given unprecedented access to artists and those involved in the staging of one of the world’s best jazz festivals, with the view of building comprehensive visual tapestries.   Both courses are for those looking to forge a career in the arts, those who have a desire to creatively preserve cultural contributions and to share with appreciative audiences.
