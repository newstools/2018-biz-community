In North America, it could rise from 100,000 to 1-million."More than half of the United States must at least double their protection level within the next two decades if they want to avoid a dramatic increase in river flood risks," said lead author Sven Willner from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).The increase in river flood risks over the next few decades is being driven by the amount of greenhouse gases already emitted into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.When more heat-trapping pollutants surround the Earth, more moisture is held in the air, leading to more rainfall. Cutting these emissions is crucial to reducing flood risks for future generations."It is clear that without limiting human-caused warming to well below two degrees Celsius (36 Fahrenheit), river flood risks in our century will increase in many regions to a level that we cannot adapt to," said Anders Levermann, a researcher at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York. "The findings should be a warning to decision-makers," added Levermann. "Doing nothing will be dangerous."Source: AFP
