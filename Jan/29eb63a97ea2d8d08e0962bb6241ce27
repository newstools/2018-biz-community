Celebrating the life of Madiba“We want to share this remarkable story with travellers from all over the world, and John Kani, a global icon in his own right, is the perfect person to help us do it. As part of project Khulisa, the province aims to develop a heritage tourism route taking in all the sites linked to President Mandela’s life here. “Robben Island is already a major drawcard for tourists, but in celebration of his 100th birthday, we aim to give travellers even more Madiba magic. We hope to unveil a new statue at City Hall later this year, and the City of Cape Town will be hosting an exhibition focussing on, amongst other things, his extraordinary life. The route will also include the Pollsmoor and Drakenstein prisons and Parliament.”Wesgro CEO, Tim Harris added: “We are extremely honoured to be working with someone of John Kani’s talent and reputation. This year we celebrate the life and values of our founding democratic President, Nelson Mandela, and we want the rest of the world to be part of this experience. By sharing Madiba’s story of hope, resoluteness and reconciliation with the rest of the world, we hope to encourage more people to visit our beautiful country.”Cape Town and the water crisisWesgro will use this opportunity to also provide the international tourism trade and other media with an update on the serious drought experienced in Cape Town, and avail itself to answer questions that may be asked. The agency has been working closely with industry stakeholders, South African Tourism, the City of Cape Town and the Western Cape Government to provide regular and factual updates to those tourists who are concerned about the impact of the drought.“Tourism supports nearly 300,000 jobs in the Western Cape. As an important contributing sector to our economy, we are concerned that tourists may choose to take the Western Cape and South Africa off their trip plans for the year ahead. We are therefore trying to provide as much clarity to those concerned about the drought, its impact, and the nature of the plans should Day Zero arrive. "We are also using the opportunity to remind tourists who do arrive before then, that Day Zero can be avoided if every person sticks to 50 litres per person a day. While international tourists only add approximately 1% to the population of the province during peak season, they should save like a local and help us push back Day Zero,” added Harris. The New York Times Travel Show kicks off on 26 January 2018.
