This is why we are open to working with, and providing data from, all exchanges to our customers so that a variety of places to trade are offered and more informed trading decisions can be made with the clearest view of what's happening around the world,” adds Shah.A2X data will be made available on Thomson Reuters’ flagship desktop platform Eikon, or via Thomson Reuters’ Elektron Data Platform. From streaming real-time data to deep historical information, Eikon provides access to trusted, timely and accurate content from more than 400 exchanges and OTC-traded markets and over 70 direct exchange feeds, delivered via Thomson Reuters Elektron low latency data feeds.
