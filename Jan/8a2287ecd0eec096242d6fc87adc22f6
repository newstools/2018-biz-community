Consumers buy into a brand and essentially enter into a relationship with that brand,” he explains.This year the survey results impacted five categories in particular. The Toyota Fortuner (Adventure SUV), Suzuki Ignis (Budget Car), Mini JCW (Fun Car), Volkswagen Amarok (Leisure Double Cab) and BMW M2 (Performance Car) all emerged victorious because actual customers rated their brands higher than the competition.Multifaceted judging processThe winners aren’t chosen exclusively by motoring journalists, who report on (and review) the latest new vehicles in the market.Although the seven members of Cars.co.za’s editorial team chose the finalists, the combined judging panel (including 11 respected guest judges from various backgrounds and fields of expertise) only compiled the finalists’ individual scores once they’d evaluated the cars back-to-back during a thorough two-day test at the Gerotek facility at the end of 2017.Combined judging panelAnele Mdoda (947), Ashley Oldfield (Cars.co.za), Ciro de Siena (Cars.co.za), Claire Mawisa (Carte Blanche), David Taylor (Cars.co.za), Eddie Kalili (freelance editor/writer), Ernest Page (SA Car Fan), Francisco Nwamba (The Motorist), Gero Lilleike (Cars.co.za), Jacob Moshokoa (947/EWN), Juliet McGuire (WOW), Khutso Theledi (YFM), Kojo Baffoe (Afropolitan), Mike Fourie (Cars.co.za), Nafisa Akabor (tech journalist), Phuti Mpyane (The Petrosexual), Wendy Knowler (Consumer Specialist) and Wezile Bonani (Bay FM).All derivatives listed on the new vehicles price list on 1 September 2017 were eligible for selection and the public had just as much say in the outcome of 2017/18 #CarsAwards as the 18 judges did. Fifty percent of the final standings were based on rankings that the respective vehicle brands achieved in the Cars.co.za Ownership Satisfaction Survey, conducted in partnership with data specialists Lightstone Consumer. The data incorporated feedback from thousands of vehicle owners, based on their experiences of their vehicles (less than five years old and serviced through franchised outlets).   The most prestigious title awarded by #CarsAwards – Brand of the Year – was based solely on the findings of the Cars.co.za Ownership Satisfaction Survey.Brand of the YearFollowing its surprise win last year, Suzuki’s good reputation received another boost from this year’s #CarsAwards. The Japanese brand again emerged victorious in the Brand of the Year category, which is determined entirely by market and customer data, the latter from the aforementioned survey (sales and after-sales service in particular). Suzuki narrowly defeated Mercedes-Benz by 1%, with Mazda scoring the final podium position. Also, note the rise of Kia (6th) and Mahindra into the top 10 list.Suzuki                        78.2%Mercedes-Benz            77.2%Mazda                         74.7%Volkswagen                 74%BMW/Mini                    73.4%Kia                              72.8%Audi                            72%Toyota/Lexus               72%Nissan                         71.4%Mahindra                     71.4%“We think the Brand of the Year trophy is the ultimate accolade in the South African automotive industry,” says Oosthuizen. “It represents validation from the people that matter most – actual car owners. Suzuki has managed to achieve impressive market share growth in the past 12 months and has maintained excellent service levels.”Visit http://www.carsawards.co.za for more information about #CarsAwards, including the category criteria, and to view images of the award recipients taken at the event.
