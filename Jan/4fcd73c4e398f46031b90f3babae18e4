There are no closed office spaces, with collaboration taking place along paths or in tree houses."Plants, trees, sunlight, soil, and water take centre stage - the sound of running water and the scent of flowering plants create an instant botanical immersion that takes visitors far away from the urban landscape," Amazon said.Amazon's quest for a second North American headquarters has thrust 20 cities into a cutthroat "Hunger Games" style contest.The technology and lifestyle powerhouse this month narrowed its list of candidates from 238 applications for the prize, which could provide an estimated $5bn in investments and 50,000 new jobs. Amazon expects to announce a decision later this year on "HQ2", which will be equal to its Seattle headquarters, and is asking the finalists to refine their pitches.Source: AFP
