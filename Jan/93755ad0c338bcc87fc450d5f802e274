(aka 'We're The Superhumans') has won the Grand Prix. As the official UK broadcaster of the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games, Channel 4 needed an integrated promotional campaign that would create a groundswell of support. The marketing focus offered the opportunity to start a conversation about disability and to change public attitudes towards it.Agencies OMD and 4creative created Channel 4's most accessible campaign, pushing media partnerships to their limit and a smart cross-platform video strategy, from Facebook AI technology delivering Facebook ads for those with sight loss to audio-enabled posters and a Snapchat filter used by over 250,000 young British people. The inclusive campaign got one in every two British people tuning into Paralympic sports and is studied in UK schools as an example of best-in-class diversity marketing as well as used by the United Nations as part of an international initiative for persons with disability.Commenting on the Grand Prix winner, jury member Dominique Touchaud, global brand strategist and associate brand director, Procter & Gamble, said: "It created emotions beyond results that even surpassed the London 2012 'Meet the Superhumans' campaign that had already set such a high standard. From a media strategy standpoint, I truly appreciate how they thought of the context (focused on the parathletes' disability) to pick up the media and design the creative."Diverse selection of winnersOne Gold has been awarded to Energy BBDO, United States, for 'Unwrapping a love story' for Mars Wrigley's Extra Gum, which accelerated its growth in the US by building emotional equity through a short film.The second Gold went to FP7/DXB, UAE, for 'The dullest ad in history for the least active kids in history' a provocative campaign about the importance of outdoor play for children created for Unilever's laundry detergent brand OMO to increase sales in the Middle East.Commenting on the winners, jury chair Charlie Chappell, head of media at The Hershey Company said, "This diverse selection of winners from across the globe represents the most effective channel integration strategies that we have ever seen through the Warc awards.
