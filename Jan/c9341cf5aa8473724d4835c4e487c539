ODA managing partner and founder John O’Donoghue took size and professionalism into consideration when selecting a network for his agency to join. “Magnet was not too big and cumbersome, and we felt we could get to know the agencies and develop relationships with them. We appreciate the professional manner in which it presented itself, and the members are a great sounding board for exchanging ideas and getting honest answers. We’re very excited by the possibilities that lie ahead.”O’Donoghue is also encouraged by the opportunities Magnet brings to ODA's clients and what it in turn brings to the network. “In South Africa, it opens the door for us to pitch clients that may need a global presence, while our clients benefit by our knowledge gained from the network.”<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425678.jpg" alt="ODA Advertising joins Magnet Global Network" width="625" height="470">(c) 123RF.comAs for collaborating with other Magnet members, O’Donoghue believes there are opportunities from a client perspective, as well as from the specialized skill set perspective ODA brings. “Additionally, the South African exchange rate makes it very cost-effective to shoot TV commercials or edit in South Africa. The same goes for 3D modeling, animation and packaging design,” he added.The firm, founded in 1991 by O’Donoghue as O’Donoghue Associates Advertising, is now known as ODA Advertising.
