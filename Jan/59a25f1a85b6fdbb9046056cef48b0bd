One such act is Royston Skippers and Lucrecia Rae - known as Tusmart. They recorded their first CD project called Made up My Mind, which was released in February 2016. The title track won an Akademia award for best jazz song for an unsigned artist in Los Angeles in April 2016. I caught up with Royston, last week, following the news that they will be performing at the Jazzathon 2018 on Friday, 19 January 2018 at 3pm. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does music mean to you?It is a vehicle to express my inner feelings..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any funny moments on stage?Being so in the moment I forget the lyrics to the song.
