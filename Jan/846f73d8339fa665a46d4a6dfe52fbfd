In 2017, there was an 18.5% increase in hotel occupancy in Victoria Falls, compared to 2016, with an additional 35,730 rooms sold across ten hotels, which together have 1,125 rooms available per night and measure arrivals monthly – a surge in December 2017 saw this year-on-year increase rise to 24% for the month.“These growth rates in key ratios are way in excess of regional industry norms and add substantial weight to the fact that Victoria Falls is back and the future is looking very bright.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/415425-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Victoria Falls Safari Club deck" width="120" height="120">Surge in arrivals, feedback prompts Victoria Falls Safari Club redevelopmentAward-winning boutique hotel, Victoria Falls Safari Club, is expected to begin redevelopment on 1 November 2017....20 Oct 2017“Reports from industry colleagues reflect occupancies from January to April this year compared to the same period last year, are up by 30% in advance bookings.“This is extremely positive news as the first quarter is usually the poorest business period in the destination,” added Kennedy. The new $150m Victoria Falls International Airport, enabling long-haul wide-bodied aircraft to land, was opened in 2016 and has since welcomed three new international airlines to the destination, while existing ones have increased capacity. “This has so far created an additional 127,000 seats into Victoria Falls per annum.” concluded Kennedy.
