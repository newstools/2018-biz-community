The North American leg of the tour, which began in September, has received rave reviews.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426397-625x276.jpg" alt="Katy Perry to tour South Africa" width="625" height="276">WITNESS: the Tour is an imaginative trip from outer-space to inner-space, from the planets to the bottom of our oceans, and a musical journey through Katy Perry’s biggest milestones and mega-hits right up to her latest album. WITNESS: The Tour is Katy’s first run since the sold-out, 151-date Prismatic World Tour, which concluded in 2015 and was hailed by Rolling Stone as "a show to damage retinas and blow minds." Katy made her Capitol Records debut with 2008’s One of the Boys after signing to the label in 2007. She  followed that up with album, Teenage Dream (2010). PRISM, her 2013 album, debuted at No. 1 on iTunes in 100 countries and has sold more than 12.5 million adjusted albums worldwide. With the singles Roar, Firework and Dark Horse each surpassing the 10 million threshold including song sales and streams, Katy is the first female artist to earn three RIAA Digital Single Diamond Awards. In her 10 years with Capitol, she has racked up a cumulative 18+ billion streams alongside worldwide sales of more than 40+ million adjusted albums and 125+ million tracks.
