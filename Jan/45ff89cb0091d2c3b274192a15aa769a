The briefing will not seek to pre-empt the outcomes of these very important investigations," the three chairpersons said."The briefing on Wednesday is not a commission of inquiry, but part of our necessary oversight role over the regulatory bodies that are investigating Steinhoff."We want them to clarify what they have done since the Steinhoff crisis broke out, the scope of their investigations, their timelines and when they intend to finish and report back to Parliament. We believe they need to be thorough but also swift and decisive."Of course, we understand that Steinhoff is being investigated by a range of organisations here and in other countries, there are court actions being considered against it and there are market-sensitive issues at stake. But within these constraints, we believe Steinhoff should still answer to Parliament in the public interest."After all, the collapse of Steinhoff shares has implications for public servants and any material losses would have to be made up for through the national fiscus because government employees have a defined benefit fund."Godi, Carrim and Mathale continued: "Our concern, though, is not just about government employees, but all workers and others who have lost out in what may well be the biggest corporate scandal the country has ever faced. We are also concerned about possible job losses in Steinhoff companies."The GEPF and PIC will also report on what implications the collapse of the Steinhoff share will have on them, what they have been doing since the crisis broke out and what lessons they have already drawn about their investment decisions."Over time, consideration will also need to be given to whether there is a need for policy and regulatory changes to reduce the prospects of the Steinhoff-type failures. The committees will consider how they jointly and separately take issues forward after the briefing.There are other parliamentary committees that also have oversight functions related to Steinhoff issues, such as the trade and industry, police, and justice and constitutional development committees. Our three committees will engage with them in this regard," said finance committee chairman Yunus Carrim, public accounts chairman Themba Godi and public service and administration chairperson Cassel Mathale.Source: BDpro
