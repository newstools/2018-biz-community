“Stellenbosch is not only the first and foremost wine route of our country, it’s also fondly known as the City of Oaks with a plethora of one-of-a-kind experiences for young and old. One such #1OAK offering is our bi-monthly street parties where a cosmopolitan crowd, charming country-style hospitality and culinary delights blend with cool tunes and quality wines,” shares Elmarie Rabe, manager of the Stellenbosch Wine Routes.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424819.jpg" alt="Drostdy Street to host the 2018 Stellenbosch Street Soirees" width="600" height="400">The Street Soirees offer food from local eateries and food vendors, award-winning wines, and live music. Cars make way for enthusiasts to sample unique dishes at street stalls, while wine farms offer delicious vintages.“We take your #WineWednesday to the next level and offer the perfect antidote to a hectic day at the office. Why not let your hair down and swap the boring TV meals for a laidback stroll and early street-style supper with friends, while you also make a few new ones along the way?” adds Rabe.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424820.jpg" alt="Drostdy Street to host the 2018 Stellenbosch Street Soirees" width="600" height="400">Every Stellenbosch Street Soiree features a different selection of cellars and caterers and entry costs R100 per person, which includes a glass and 12 wine tasting tokens. Food dishes are priced individually by vendors. These communal parties are from 6pm to 8pm and children are welcome.
