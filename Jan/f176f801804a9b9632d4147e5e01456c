With many of our fellow countrymen struggling to make ends meet, brands have stepped in to provide them with a picture of a future worth striving for.The global customer-centricity study, Insights 2020, led by research firm Kantar Millward Brown, has attempted to understand how brands could drive customer-centric growth as well as the factors that really make a difference. The research surveyed 10,495 individuals in 60 countries, and there are some significant efforts worth investing in if brands want to engage where it matters most, in consumers' hearts.The research uncovered that for market-leading companies and brands, traditional value drivers such as quality, packaging, or distribution were necessary, but no longer provide a competitive advantage; most brands are capable of providing these drivers. What is important, are a few critical approaches.Purpose-led brandsThe study found that when companies or brands linked to a purpose, 80% of them outperformed the market. Only 32% of non-purpose led brands managed to perform better than the market. On the groundIt is important to engage with consumers in their space and on their terms. Through the use of memorable campaigns, experiential events and activations it is critical to engage with consumers on their turf.Be truthful and authenticConsumers can smell something inauthentic a mile away, especially when it's coming from a brand. This forces brands to strive for authenticity in everything they do, especially when it comes to marketing. Building values and principle-based attributes into your brand as a guiding tool is essential. Helping consumers commitBy allowing individuals to attach themselves to a brand with a purpose, it helps consumers personally commit to a cause that they consider important. When a consumer is personally invested, the link between the brand and product or service deepens.Balancing heritage and modern relevanceThere is a continuous tussle in balancing the traditional market, transitional market and the new consumer’s brands are trying to attract. Keeping the heritage and roots of the brand true to itself while creating relevance for the new market is a battle marketers are still fighting.
