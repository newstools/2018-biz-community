Someone tell me why I’ve been sleeping on Buddha bowls the past few months! �� I had them all the time in the summer and until like last week i had forgotten how satisfying and tastayy they are. Deets for this one below! On a side note, i had quite the relaxing day to myself today! Did an early workout this morning at the gym followed by that delicious toast i posted, walked the dogs, worked on my online class, went and saw a movie, and somewhere between all of that i had the aforementioned Buddha bowl. Hope you all had a great day yourselves �� • • In the bowl ����: spinach, quinoa, avo (I’m really liking it now guys!��), shredded carrot, roasted Japanese sweet potato, corn, pesto, salsa, broccoli shoots, everything bagel seasoning, hemp hearts, and pepitas!

The better we can understand our consumers, the better we can serve them through products built with their needs in mind.” Uber Eats SA GM Nic Robertson explains further, “In 2017 we saw South Africans embrace plant and superfood-based meals with trendsetters like avocado on toast and poke bowls going mainstream. Plant-based foods are set to increase in popularity in 2018, with ingredients such as cucumber, avocado, and even sriracha likely to appear on menus across the country.    Happy Friday �� Dreaming of this Buddha bowl consist of wild black rice and sautéed garlic mushroom + spicy avocado dip and all the goodness �� Have fun �� --------------------------------------------#buddhabowl #healthychoice #vegetarian #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #plantbased #avocado #avodaily #toastsforall #toasttuesday #bestofavocado #theavocadoshow #avocadolover #poweredbyplants #eatplants #plantspower #feelgoodfood #colourfulfood #avolove #avo #sexyavos @bestofavocado @avocadotoast @sexyavos #the_purple_seed #Vegan #veganfood #veganofig #veganfoodshare #whatveganeats @letscookvegan #healthyfood @nutrition_planet @thefeedfeed #veganfoodporn #droolclub #lovefood @veganfoodspot A post shared by  MARIAM ���� (@the_purple_seed) on Jan 25, 2018 at 11:26pm PST Novelty foods like rainbow inspired dishes or trendy foods such as those with ingredients dyed black are also high our 2018 wish list.
