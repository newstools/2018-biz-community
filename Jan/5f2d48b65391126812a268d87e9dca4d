Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2020.The airline is already the world's biggest customer for the A380 with 101 in its fleet and 41 more firm orders previously placed.Airbus hopes that by continuing the programme for the next 10 years or even beyond, potential customers of the A380 will decide to order the aircraft, especially in China.The group's decision in 2007 to pursue the A380, capable of packing in 853 seats, was diametrically opposed to rival Boeing's bet on the Dreamliner, marketed as a more efficient plane that could be used for both medium and long-distance flights.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425627-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Airbus overtakes Boeing, says could halt A380 programme" width="120" height="120">Airbus overtakes Boeing, says could halt A380 programmeEuropean aerospace giant Airbus overtook arch-rival Boeing in terms of aircraft orders last year, but warned that it could cease making its A380 jet if it does not receive any more orders for the supersize plane...18 Jan 2018But the economics of the four-engine A380 have proved daunting, with airlines having to operate every flight at full capacity in order to make a profit.Airbus sales director John Leahy had said on Monday that the company would have to halt the A380 programme unless Emirates placed another order.Enders, 59, told the Airbus board of directors last month that he would not seek reappointment as CEO when his current term ends in April.Source: AFP
