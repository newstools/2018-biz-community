"They are best placed to investigate activity on their platform."Collins had previously criticised Facebook for doing "no work" in its initial probe of Russia's alleged disinformation campaign.The UK Electoral Commission had asked the company to look at accounts identified as part of Russia's "Internet Research Agency" of trolls and propagandists, which interfered in the US presidential election.Facebook concluded last month that their impact in Britain was limited because they had spent so little on adverts before the referendum.But Collins' sceptical committee asked the company to look again.In his letter to MPs, Milner said Facebook believed the Russia-linked accounts identified "seemed to be the most likely area" to find evidence of meddling in Britain, and agreed to look deeper into records.Collins added in his statement: "I look forward to seeing the results of this investigation, and I'm sure we will want to question Facebook about this when we know the outcome."Executives from the platform, as well as from Twitter and Google, are due to give evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into fake news in February, when MPs will visit America for the occasion.
