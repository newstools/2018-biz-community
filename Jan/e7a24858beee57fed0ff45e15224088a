All vying for one of 12 spaces on the Threads programme, participants had to have confirmed creative accolades and prove their business acumen through a series of activities. Found to be this year’s best, the chosen candidates also had to have established fashion brands:•	Tshepo Mohlala of Tshepo The Jean Maker, JHB•	Tshego Manche of La Manche Clothing, JHB•	Junior Mmotla of Mamagasehome, JHB•	Anthony Smith of 2BOP, CT•	Madja Robin of Chimpel, CT•	Thabo Makhetha of Thabo Maketha, CT•	Yameka Lize of Refined Revolt, PE•	Asanda Mali of Mal’stones by Asanda Mali, PE•	Evan Zemba of WIC Designs, PE•	Lyndall Moodley of Hannah Grace Maternity, DBN•	Jacqueline Munsami of JSE Couture, DBN•	Sabiha Badsha of Haya Collective, DBNAccording to the organisers, the Threads accelerator was established as a response to a continent-wide problem, one that is especially prevalent in South Africa. "The global fashion industry is worth $3 trillion, but Africa’s efforts account for just 1% of that, even including the manufacturing and textile industry. We know that Africa doesn’t lack creativity, talent and access to resources; the main stumbling block is the inability of entrepreneurs to turn their brands into viable businesses that create jobs and profits, and, so, make a positive impact on the economy."Small- and medium-sized businesses need to become the engine room of jobs and growth in the coming years, but poor planning is a major reason why as many as 70% of SMEs fail in South Africa – half of them within the first five years. Thus, skills training is inseparable from entrepreneurship: changes in- and outside a business will require sound strategies to meet the challenges involved, such as securing supplies, leveraging existing cross-border trade agreements and gaining access to markets. The Threads accelerator can teach entrepreneurs all of this." To ensure a solid academic foundation, Threads partnered with E4Impact, an initiative of Italy’s Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore that fosters sustainable development through impact entrepreneurship. Each week the accelerator tackles a specific area of business with some of South Africa’s top minds as custodians. Modules cover finance and business plans, manufacturing, e-commerce, marketing, selling methods and more. At the end of the 12 weeks, in March 2018, a programme winner will be selected by a panel of industry-experienced judges. The winner receives a package that includes a trade trip to Europe to meet top retailers and buyers, a sponsored Mercedes Benz for one year and an SME banking starter pack from Standard Bank.
