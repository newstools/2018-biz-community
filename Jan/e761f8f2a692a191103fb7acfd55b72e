Sources say that the state faces the quandary of having to validate Pauw's claims if the information disclosed is proven true in court."In what amounts to a relentless campaign of intimidation, there have also been threats of civil suits against Pauw and NB Publishers. Through attorney Willem de Klerk and with senior counsel, NB and Pauw have co-operated with the authorities but have also made it clear that they stand by the book and are prepared to defend it," the statement read.Media Monitoring Africa said the legal defence fund was a crucial part of a campaign to protect the right to freedom of speech. The organisation's website included details for South Africans who wished to contribute money to the defence fund.Source: BDpro
