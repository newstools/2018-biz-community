"In our view, making the feed more relevant should boost user and engagement growth over time."Facebook is making the service more social and less media, and that's likely a positive for the vast majority of users," Weiser said.RBC Capital Markets said lower user engagement with the site may provide a "headwind to growth in the near-term," but the changes will be "helpful for the long-term health of the business."While analysts were sanguine, some users, particularly publishers, were worried.Susann Hoffman, co-founder of the German website Edition F, said she was upset that the move had been done without any consultation."I am personally quite unhappy with the fact that Facebook decides for its users what is relevant to them and what not," Hoffman said.She argued for more personalisation - giving users a greater ability to decide for themselves which content they would like to see.
