Where do you live, work and play?I live, work and play mostly in my head. Growing up as an only child with mainly adults around, I managed to escape and create my own world where I can go to think, play and develop ideas. In the physical world, I spend a lot of time in Jozi, Manguzi and Cape Town. 2. What’s your claim to fame? Depends who you ask! I guess the PR version would be:I'm most known for founding South Africa's largest black-owned and -managed advertising agency, the award-winning Avatar, which has grown rapidly over the past five years, winning blue-chip clients and generally kicking ass. I'm also the founding partner of M&N Brands, SA’s first 100% black-owned marketing and communications holding Group that aims to compete with global advertising networks, and fast-track transformation in the industry.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/422653-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mela Events owners,Enelra Booth (L) and Tiziana Tucci (R) with M&amp;N Brands Group CEO, Zibusiso Mkhwanazi." width="120" height="120">M&N Brands: Building an SA-owned ad network, for Africans, by AfricansEarlier this week, it was announced that M&N Brands has acquired Mela Events.

Describe your career so far. Completely different to what I thought it would be. Having studied law, economics and politics, I never thought I would end up selling ideas for a living. I've enjoyed every bit, from the time I was a non-executive director at Ireland Davenport (the youngest at the time in the entire WPP global network at the age of 26), to starting my own agencies. I have been lucky to work on some amazing brands such as BMW, Apple, Investec, Fox International Brands, Brand SA, Caltex, SAA and National Geographic, to mention a few, so it’s been a beautiful journey so far but I feel like it’s only the beginning... 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. I love being with my family, I love travelling, playing chess, church, music and eating traditional African food.5. What do you love about your industry? I love that the industry is at a revolutionary stage. The innovation and new dominance of technology makes it a 'not business as usual' industry, meaning there is no Goliath, as history and experience don't automatically mean you're the best. It’s a race to keep up with the changes to stay relevant and impactful.  6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. The best thing is that no two days are the same. Essentially, we are problem solvers for brands and the issues differ brief by brief. Being an entrepreneur is also very exciting, as you get to see your business and staff grow through the years.  7. What are the tools of your trade? A sharp, consistent brain with the ability to translate consumer insight into effective communication to achieve the desired outcomes. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? The agencies that are taking transformation seriously; especially in achieving diversity in the strategy and creative departments. 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Lack of transformation and a lack of the will to transform. Actually, the general lack of understanding around transformation and why it needs to happen.Lack of understanding/real insights to effectively communicate with the black market... can we stop dancing in ads, please! <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1704/386938-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrabs from the Vivo ad." width="120" height="120">Find black actors.

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. I believe the industry is moving so fast in innovation that buzzwords and catchphrases get outdated quickly. The only constant is the role and impact of technology in communication and engagement with the consumer. So I guess the most stable buzzword that is not a trend or stage of development is 'technology,' nta nta nta da!12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Whenever there are humans to observe around me, whether it’s at a restaurant, wedding, church, eKasi, traffic and even at funerals *hides*. People are constantly giving insights for free in public, our role as creatives is to be 'sponges' so we can use those insights as the core ingredient for great creative work. 13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I think the ability to make flights with all the odds of time against me. If it’s still on the ground, I can make that flight.  14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? An aspirant technophile.15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Travel pictures, Twitter, Viber, emails and missed calls. 16.What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? It sounds like a cliché, but the industry is hungry for originality, so when you enter the industry don't let it standardise you, fight to remain yourself. And yes: 'don't do drugs'. I've seen some great creatives go down as a result of substance abuse. Our bodies and brains are our tools, keep them healthy.  Simple as that.
