And those pies are proving to be just perfect, with Produce Sound having produced a fantastic amount of work for a wide range of agencies and clients in 2017. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1705/392331-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Louis Enslin, owner, composer and producer of Produce Sound." width="120" height="120">The producers' wrap: Louis Enslin of Produce SoundI spoke to some of the people responsible for SA's recent One Show-winning work, behind the scenes. First up is Louis Enslin of Produce Sound.By Leigh Andrews 16 May 2017Many of those garnered further recognition at the Loeries. For example, in the radio category, they were responsible for the overall Grand Prix for KFC ‘Sad Man Meal’, by Ogilvy Johannesburg.They were also responsible for campaign silver for KFC ‘Virgin Mojito’; gold for ‘US Presidents by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris for Flight Centre Student Flights; campaign silver and a campaign craft certificate for ‘World Gone Mad - A.I., Knowledge, Climate Change’ by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris for Flight Centre Student Flights; campaign bronze for ‘Know your partner - Nostril, Bee, Birthmark’ by TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris for Mattel; campaign bronze for ‘Suck it up - Slow Clap, Passport Photo’ by FCB’s 1886 for Steers; campaign bronze for ‘KFC Suppertime Stories’ by Ogilvy Johannesburg; bronze for ‘Inkanyamba’ by DDB for Medal Paints.When it comes to TV, film and video communication, they produced yet more winning work, in the form of bronze for ‘Afronaut’, by Joe Public for Chicken Licken; bronze for ‘Tale of Note’, by Joe Public for Nedbank; with bronze for ‘KFC Suppertime Stories’ by Ogilvy Johannesburg in the category of digital and interactive communication: mobile media and digital integrated campaign bronze for ‘See Money Differently’ by Native VML for Nedbank.Reaping the rewards of ‘gooi-ing mielies’This production perfection was further reflected in the Loeries Rankings, with Produce Sound popping up as sixth best TV recording studio, Enslin ranked second in the composer/engineer table, and Produce Sound taking top honours as the number one radio recording studio for the fourth year in a row.This should come as no surprise as the Produce Sound team ‘gooi mielies’ at everything they do, and truly does love radio and all things audio. They thank all their amazing clients who trust them with their work because without them, they’re “just button-pushers.” They love to experiment and find new, sometimes crazy, ways to design sound – they even dabble in virtual reality (VR).<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1701/374977-120x120.png?2" alt="Team Produce Sound in celebratory mode." width="120" height="120">Producing winning sound: SA's radio advertising success plays onJohannesburg-based Produce Sound's owner Louis Enslin shares the good news about the state of SA's audio advertising...By Leigh Andrews 12 Jan 2017Enslin himself is a formally trained, award-winning sound engineer with over 20 years’ experience in live sound, studio recording, music production, jingle composition and post production.

You just never know..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us who you personally admire in the industry. Wow, there are so many, I can’t possibly choose just one or two! One of the people I most admire in the industry is Graham Smith. Not for his work necessarily, though he’s not a bad editor, but rather for his attitude. Perspective takes you a long way.And then, not as much a newcomer and a new thinker is Cameron Naidoo from anti-traditional creative agency, Guerilla.I think in many ways, the old way of the industry is dying and there are new directions we need to think in. Naidoo is one of them, getting this right.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1410/235646-120x120.jpg" alt="[NewsMaker] Cameron Naidoo; Louis Enslin" width="120" height="120"> Cameron Naidoo; Louis EnslinA new agency called Three D Radio has launched an interesting advertising concept for cinema audiences in partnership with Ster-Kinekor and Cinemark...By Louise Marsland 24 Oct 2014Lots to look forward to creatively from 2018!
