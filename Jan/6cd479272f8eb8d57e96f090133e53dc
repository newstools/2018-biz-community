A deep and unspoken truth, representing the cultural legacy between two brothers, is at the centre of the series’ captivating plot. Showcasing local talent at its best, Imbewu: The Seed will see up-and-coming performers ply their craft alongside legendary actors.The cross-cultural drama series is produced by Grapevine Productions, a joint venture between Videovision Entertainment, Word Of Mouth Pictures and Luyks Productions. Anant Singh from Videovision Entertainment and Duma Ndlovu from Word Of Mouth Pictures will be at the helm of the production of the show. Singh's international recognition is overwhelming with credits that include the films Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom; the Oscar nominated Yesterday and Sarafina! both of which starred Leleti Khumalo. South African audiences are very familiar with Ndlovu’s work. Having produced successful local soapies and drama series, Ndlovu’s name has become synonymous with excellence on the small screen.   Anant Singh states that Imbewu: The Seed will be in a class of its own, “Imbewu: The Seed reflects the multi-cultural environment which makes Durban and the province of KwaZulu-Natal unique. The show has the ability to cross the cultural divide and promote social cohesion in South Africa, showcasing a hybrid of cultures in South Africa today. We are extremely excited to be embarking on this amazing television series in KwaZulu-Natal with our partners, e.tv.” says Singh. Duma Ndlovu explains his excitement about the crossover of cultures that will be represented in the show. "We, as storytellers, are very excited for this opportunity to tell an authentic South African story. I am excited to be partnering with Anant Singh and Leleti Khumalo as we prepare to give South Africans a new and unique story. In South Africa, we have not yet had the opportunity to see Indians and Africans come together to tell a story with a social cohesion message and Imbewu: The Seed will deliver this to audiences." says Ndlovu. GM of e.tv Local Content Ziyanda Mngomezulu is confident viewers will love what they see on Imbewu: The Seed. “One of e.tv's commitments in 2018 is to invest in provinces beyond Gauteng.
