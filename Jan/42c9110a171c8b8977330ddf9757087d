The performance line-up at the JazzTown Marquee will be led by Judith Sephuma and Jimmy Nevis along with a string of country’s jazz musicians and rising talent in the local jazz arena. Dubbed the queen of Afro-jazz, Sephuma is known for her multi-status selling jazz albums and her platinum-status selling gospel album The Experience Live in Concert. Her sultry, melodic voice has dominated airwaves since the release of her triple platinum-status selling debut album A Cry, A Smile, A Dance in 2001. With his quirky lyrics, soulful vocals, catchy melodies and inimitable musical style, Jimmy Nevis is the darling of the local music front. He recently released his third studio album - Quarter Life Crisis - which maintains his high standards as he constantly strives to exceed his and everyone else’s expectations. These two musicians will share the stage with some of Mzansi’s most admired jazz musicians, among them young and happening jazz/soul musician Ndumiso Manana, Standard Bank Young Artist-Jazz award-winner Mark Fransman and DJ Joy Mode aka Joey Modiba, whose soulful jazz house beats transcend musical genres.  Also on the line-up are two-time Metro FM Music award-winning jazz vocalist Nomfundo Xaluvu, Cape Town's original ‘saxy vibes’ wizard Don Vino and musical maestro Khenzero – aka Kenneth Bekizizwe Nzama.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1710/415714.jpg" alt="Style ahead of the field at the Sun Met 2018" width="120" height="120">Style ahead of the field at the Sun Met 2018At a glitzy event launch, 'Style ahead of the Field' was announced as the theme for the 134th edition of the Sun Met, celebrated with G.H.
