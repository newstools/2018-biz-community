We will be expanding our product offering considerably to all South African consumers,” says Harman, “and so, it makes perfect sense for us to increase the efficiencies of our manufacturing and wholesale divisions, enabling us to improve the competitive pricing/quality advantage of our products.” For these reasons Bata South Africa (Bata SA) has announced that it is contemplating a rationalisation/restructuring process within its retail division in South Africa. This process is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2018.Founded in 1894, Bata is the world’s leading shoemaker by volume. The company is a family-owned business globally with a footprint of 5,300 stores and producing locally in 23 Bata-owned manufacturing facilities across five continents.
