We are excited to be working with such a well-known and respected brand that plays such an integral part in consumers’ lives, and look forward to showcasing how digital innovation can continue to increase the stronghold of the brand in South Africa.”Seems the feeling is mutual, as Cherisse Erwee, head of marketing for Defy confirms: "We are excited to begin work with Liquorice and look forward to a highly successful working relationship."Defy joins Liquorice clients Unilever, Distell, Pioneer Foods, SA Home Loans, Sanlam, Michelin, Avon and Dimension Data, bringing in a completely new segment of the market into the portfolio, specifically major domestic appliances. We'll keep an eye out for their tradition-defying digital and social work!
