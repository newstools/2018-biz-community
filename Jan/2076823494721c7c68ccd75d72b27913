Our newest arrival in particular, the Marco Polo Horizon, is proving very popular and has played a decisive role in the growth of the Marco Polo family. Which is why we have now decided to launch the newcomer in a right-hand drive version, too", continues Mornhinweg.Pickup camper vans: the department for adventure in a booming marketSimply to set off and to stop and stay where the fancy takes you: flexibility and independence are the most powerful motives for customers deciding to purchase a camper van. Between January and October 2017 almost 38,000 new vehicles were registered across all classes of camper vans, according to the German Caravanning Industry Association (Caravaning Industrie Verband). That is some 5,000 more than in the same period of the previous year.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424973-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Mercedes-Benz Vans reveals camper van concepts based on X-Class bakkie" width="625" height="325">Customers these days also tend to use their homes on wheels for trips to remoter regions that lie off the beaten track. Camping has become an adventure and a chance to enjoy nature to the fullest. Campers need two things for this: a vehicle with off-road capability, which is also comfortable for long journeys cross-country, and a living area with all vital essentials. Pickups with camper van solutions onboard meet these requirements, and thus find their fanbase. In many cases the mobile home section can be demounted in a few easy steps, leaving the pickup to function as a straightforward vehicle for everyday use.The new X-Class has wide track, coil springs at the front and rear, long wheelbase and the comfortable spring and damping system typical of Mercedes. Two four-cylinder engines deliver the necessary dynamism with an output of 120kW (fuel consumption combined: 7.6-7.4 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 200-195 g/km) and an output of 140kW (fuel consumption combined: 7.9-7.3 l/100km; combined CO2 emissions: 207-192 g/km).From mid-2018 a high-torque V6 diesel engine with all-wheel drive as standard will provide even more agility. The outstanding traction of the all-wheel drive models comes courtesy of the low-range gearing and an optional differential lock on the rear axle. A fording depth of up to 600mm, a ground clearance of as much as 222mm (optional suspension with raised ground clearance), a maximum gradeability of 100 percent and DSR (Downhill Speed Regulation) mean that the X-Class is ideally equipped to cope on even the most challenging of trails. With a towing capacity of up to 3.5 t, it is also capable of towing a wide variety of trailers, including caravans.Camper van concepts based on the X-Class from Tischer and VanEssa mobilcamping at the CMTThe Mercedes-Benz booth at the CMT 2018 sees the debut of some first camper van concepts based on the X-Class.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424974-625x325.jpg?1" alt="Mercedes-Benz Vans reveals camper van concepts based on X-Class bakkie" width="625" height="325">Despite its compact size, the demountable cabin from bodybuilder Tischer offers a comfortable sleeping system in an alcove 150cm wide, headroom of almost two metres, a kitchen with a three-burner gas stove and three seats. The latter can be converted into a second bed. With its large, fold-away wash basin and swivelling toilet unit, the integrated bathroom manages to offer enough space to take a shower. A different concept on the basis of the X-Class has been developed by VanEssa mobilcamping: a heavy-duty pull-out module weighing around 250kg with a fully equipped kitchen - including such features as a coolbox, cooking and washing-up facilities as well as space for crockery and supplies. A second pull-out module offers even more space for further items. VanEssa protects the load compartment with a cover made out of yacht-deck-look teak wood, a water-resistant material particularly characterised by its strength and durability. Special pneumatic struts allow the cover to be propped up at an angle of 45 degrees. For trips over several days, VanEssa advises the fitting of a roof tent with rear-facing entrance.Get-together at the CMT: the complete Marco Polo family on displayAlso on display on the Mercedes booth at the CMT, alongside the X-Class, is the complete Marco Polo family - in each case as an Edition model with a host of extras as standard.New for the compact Marco Polo travel van from April 2018 is a sound system with nine speakers, including a subwoofer and a five-channel DSP amplifier.
