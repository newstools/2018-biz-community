"The TDA is spearheading a number of projects that are critical to the spatial transformation of the city, and in establishing an integrated public transport system that will bring down the cost of transport and the time residents spend on commuting between their homes and work. "The turn-around plan for urban commuter rail, and the provision of affordable and inclusionary housing on well-located land, count among the key priorities the city will be focusing on in the coming months. Fortune will oversee these projects, as well as a number of other initiatives. We have a lot of work to do, and I am enthusiastic and excited about seeing these projects come to fruition," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport and Urban Development, Councillor Brett Herron.
