Resilient's strategy is to invest in dominant regional retail centres with a minimum of three anchor tenants and let predominantly to national retailers. A core competency was the successful development of new malls and extensions to existing malls, said De Beer.Resilient also invests in listed and offshore property-related assets. As of 18 December, Resilient was included in the FTSE/JSE top 40 index. This resulted in an increase in liquidity of its shares and volatility in its share price."Sentiment has improved in SA and gross domestic product growth has begun to come through. November and December were very good. November really stood out as people spent on specials," said De Beer.The company's mall in Richards Bay performed very well. Looking at its offshore assets, the central European investment case was still strong for the long term."We like central Europe and expect yield compression to come through. There is a rising European interest cycle which is a negative buy over the long term and we are well positioned in the region," said De Beer.Resilient's dividends are forecast to rise 13% for the 2018 financial year and 12% for the 2019 year.Peter Clark, a portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management, said the results "showed no surprises".Source: Business Day
