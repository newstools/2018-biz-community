"Long-term investors don't put too much weight on short-term noise around share price movements. The market pays up for distributions and capital growth."Resilient owns great assets. They own dominant centres in Romania, Poland and Bulgaria through Nepi Rockcastle. These centres have above-average trading density growth."Resilient had been in eastern Europe for nearly 10 years, longer than any other South African real estate fund.Chetty praised the dealmaking abilities and strategy of the group. "Resilient have a proven track record in terms of executing yield-enhancing deals. Their property approach is a disciplined one. They keep gearing at moderate levels and don't overpay for assets."Source: Business Day
