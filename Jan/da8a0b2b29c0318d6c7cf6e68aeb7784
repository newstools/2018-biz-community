Resilient's share price closed 7.3% lower on 10 January, and then plunged as much as 22% on 11 January before closing 4.4% lower. The tweets from the fake account could not be found at 1.15pm on Thursday. A company spokesperson said that only three tweets were sent using the account. These did not say anything interesting, and the company's complaint was the account used Resilient's logo to make it appear legitimate.Twitter promptly deleted the fake account once Resilient reported it, and the company has now opened an official account, which so far just says the following: "@ResilientREIT hasn't tweeted. When they do, their tweets will show up here." Resilient's share price was trading at R129.71 on Thursday, about 12% lower than its closing price on 9 January before some rumour sparked panic selling.The Reit calmed the market to some extent on 11 January by saying it expected to report on 8 February its interim dividend would be between 13% and 13.5% higher than in a matching period a year earlier.Source: BDpro
