Contikiâ€™s The Power of Travel research indicates that Europe is a key destination for South Africans, with the UK, Italy, France and Germany all making it into young South Africans' bucket list destinations. The various foods, languages, music and art scenes that can be explored in Europe enable an increased open mind with research stating 13% of travellers are more likely to place a high value on open-mindedness. The research findings also show that 63% young travellers indicate that travel has shaped their perspective on global politics. This is most prevalent with young South Africans aspiring to travel to the United States as their number one destination for 2018. With the current US climate, travelling to this destination is a great way to become more involved in global issues and the effects it may have on their own country, whilst also gaining a greater sense of citizenship. China and Japan are two destinations that prove young South Africans are inclined to experience different cultures; increasing their cultural awareness and opening their minds to learn about diverse ways of living. This is backed up by research indicating that 75% of travellers have created an awareness of other cultures that have led to increased tolerance and/or compassion. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425106-625x366.png" alt="Young South Africans pick the US as top travel destination" width="625" height="366">Top 10 destinations young South Africans want to travel to in 2018The United StatesThe UKAustraliaBrazilChinaCanadaGermanyFranceItalyJapan
