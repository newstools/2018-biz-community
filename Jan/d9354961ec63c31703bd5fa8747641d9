The results update comes two days after Britain's competition regulator provisionally ruled that Sky's planned takeover was not in the public interest.21st Century Fox has bid 11.4 billion for the 61-percent of Sky it does not already own but in Britain concerns linger over the strengthening influence of Australian-born US tycoon Murdoch.The UK regulator on Tuesday said that the deal would hand Murdoch "too much control" over UK news -- and therefore too much power in swaying public opinion.At the same time, the Competition and Markets Authority indicated that its plurality concerns would fall away on completion of Disney's takeover of 21st Century Fox.In a twist to the Sky saga, Disney announced in December a $52.4-billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox.
