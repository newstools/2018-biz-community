A passion for creating beautifully crafted characters, paired with her industry experience as a creative, means she's a force to be reckoned with. Oh, and she's a pretty damn good director too, just ask Ellen Degeneres... Having been instrumental in creating some of the most iconic characters on our screens, Cindy comments: "I will give up my whole art direction budget, my whole wardrobe budget, just to make sure I get the right cast. You have to start there. Everything hangs on an actor, everything. You can have the most incredible script, but if you've got a bad actor, forget it."
