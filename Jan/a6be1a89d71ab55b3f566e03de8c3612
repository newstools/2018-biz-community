Marketing executive Toni Joubert had briefed the agency team late last year (2017) to create a campaign that acknowledges the diversity of South African society and culture. This, she said, often results in multi-faceted families and groups of friends within Debonairs Pizza’s broad target market of male and females between 25 and 49 years of age. “Debonairs Pizza, as one of South Africa’s most loved brands and one that is entrenched in the hearts and souls – not to mention stomachs – of many of its citizens, wanted to pay respect to the differences that make our country the interesting, dynamic, vibrant and loveable place that it is,” she said. FCB Joburg’s strategic team responded with "Celebrate Different", a concept it believes can live well beyond this first campaign, which goes by the name, "Someone’s coming over". “Celebrate Difference is our Never Finished idea for the Awesome Foursome™,” said Creative Director, Greg Cameron. “South Africa is an incredibly heterogeneous country with different people, different upbringings, different ideas and different tastes – often existing in one family or group of friends. With six different flavours to choose from, the Awesome Foursome is the ideal meal to satisfy diverse tastes. It makes it so easy to celebrate our differences and enjoy a meal together the way we like it,” he said. Conceived by art director Jonathan Wolberg and copywriter Paul Frade under the creative direction of Cameron, the TVC broke this week (9 January 2018) on SABC, e.tv and DStv channels and will be followed within a few weeks by a 20-second cut-down. The commercial tells the story of a young lady who had invited several very interesting characters to dinner at her parents' place over the years. Her somewhat old-fashioned dad, in particular, had found it difficult to relate to these guests, especially the different ways they had chosen to express their personalities. However, when a beautiful, professional woman accompanies her, in spite of his surprise that she is a woman, he is finally able to relate to the fact that she is a doctor. The ad was shot over two days by Darling Films (characters and storyline) and Hungry Films (food scenes) by Mzi Kumalo and Ian Difford respectively.
