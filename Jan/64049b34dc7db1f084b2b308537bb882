We recruit talent with this objective in mind, while working closely with local labourers, sub-contractors and empowered suppliers on our projects to develop and grow their businesses. This is the underlying principle in everything we do, and assists us in achieving our important BBBEE objectives,” Sedibe says. Nine Mechanical Engineering (ME) Potential Emerging (PE) contractorIn a further development, M&D Construction Group has been graded as a nine Mechanical Engineering (ME) Potential Emerging (PE) contractor by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). This complements the contractor’s longstanding nine Civil Engineering (CE) and nine General Building (GB) grading on the CIDB’s Register of Contractors. Raghubir concludes, “These classifications reflect the sheer extent of the skills and capabilities, as well as financial capacities of the company in the various specialist fields in which we operate. While 2017 was a challenging year for the construction industry, economic growth is expected to pick up moderately in 2018 and 2019, and we look forward to continuing our long association with government and the private sector in delivering world-class infrastructure in the country.”
