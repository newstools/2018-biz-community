However, the company deemed the economics of building a mine to be unfavourable and kept it mothballed as it sought a buyer.The Finnish arm of London-based private equity group CD Capital Natural Resources Fund make the purchase, paying over the $40m in cash."The divestment of APP is consistent with our strategy of divesting non-core assets, and reinforces the focus that Gold Fields continues to show in relation to its asset portfolio," Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland said in a statement on Wednesday."We are pleased to have balanced the purchase price between up-front cash and continued long-term exposure through the royalty, and believe this to be a positive outcome for both parties," he said, referring to the 2% net smelter royalty once the metal comes into production.Gold Fields has gold mines in SA, Ghana, Australia and Peru, with the latter being a copper and gold mine.Source: BDpro
