In a new TV campaign that hits our screens on 16 January 2018, OLX has partnered with Savanah’s Comic of the Year winner, Skhumba Hlope, to show how easy it is to make smart financial choices by buying and selling on OLX. Skhumba, who is seen acting the role of “People’s Side Bae”, shares his humourous tips and advice on how to set yourself economically free, varying from selling a double bed because “single beds are for single people” to avoiding “progress in reverse” by selling that vrrrpha. You can follow OLX’s new spokesperson on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for daily doses of wisdom. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425780-625x288.jpg" alt="Escape the Januworry blues and enjoy economic freedom with OLX" width="625" height="288">“Being a part of this campaign was an easy decision for me because I’m always looking for new and exciting ways to help my community. After all, we all know that talking about money isn’t easy and we could do without the stress of stretching a paycheck to pay the bills. Being part of a campaign that deals with that and shows you an easy solution – buying and selling on OLX, I couldn’t say no,” comments Skhumba. OLX is the perfect answer for win-win deals, where people sell the things they no longer need to those who are looking for a great deal. This way, you can either make money, or save money… or both! Talking about the campaign, OLX South Africa’s Country Manager, Thembani Biyam, says, “We wanted to strike a balance in not taking ourselves too seriously while addressing a topic that’s important to everyone in an engaging, relevant way. We want to show people that OLX offers a fast, simple, safe and local way of being financially smart. With Black River FC’s expertise, we found the right person for the job in Skhumba and we’re excited to have him on board.” While many believe January has eight weeks, you can rely on OLX to work that much harder for you this January by turning your goods into cash, turning Januworry into an economically free January!
