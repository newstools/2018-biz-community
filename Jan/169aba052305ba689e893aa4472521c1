The appointment of Reatile provides an exciting opportunity for the agency to leverage the fantastic foundation already created, in order to deliver growth to our clients,” says Gareth Leck, Group CEO at Joe Public. Reatile has had a luminous career in public relations and brings with her a wealth of experience across various industries garnered from the following senior positions: Head of PR and Communications at pan-African broadcaster Econet Media, Business Unit Head at Magna Carta, and Head of PR at Liberty Group. With senior experience on both client and agency side, Reatile brings a unique perspective to this role. As the communications industry landscape continues to evolve and becomes increasingly competitive, it is more evident that businesses need to identify and grow talent that is creative and agile. A team of people who are creative and passionate, who have vast and dynamic skill sets within the integrated agency space, are critical to growing clients’ brands for the group. “Nurturing of this type of team will ensure that we remain at the forefront of what is a dynamic and fast-changing industry. Our focus will be on ensuring that PR remains a relevant and necessary part of any brand’s arsenal by delivering responsive and authentic strategies. The landscape is shifting. The future of PR will build on the legacy and lessons of the past but will not look like the past,” concludes Reatile Tekateka, Managing Partner at Engage Joe Public.
