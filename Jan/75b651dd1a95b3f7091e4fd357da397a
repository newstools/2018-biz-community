The turbocharged engine, which is standard for both the Polo Trendline and Comfortline, is both agile and efficient. The three-cylinder engine with torque of up to 175Nm (2,000 rpm) accelerates the Polo to 100km/h in  10.8 seconds. With a top speed of 187km/h it reaches the level of the first Golf GTI. These figures apply to both the five-speed manual gearbox version and the optional seven-speed DSG version for this engine. The high agility is coupled with low combined fuel consumption of 4.5 l/100km (corresponding to 103g/km CO2). The seven-speed DSG has a fuel consumption of 4.7 l/100km and emits 107 g/km of CO2.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426049-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Volkswagen SA offers ride-hailing and more with pioneer Kigali plant" width="120" height="120">Volkswagen SA offers ride-hailing and more with pioneer Kigali plantVolkswagen SA (VWSA) has launched a subsidiary company in Rwanda to build cars and provide the country with transport services such as car-sharing and Uber-style ride-hailing...22 Jan 20181.0 TSI with 85 kW.

The four valves per cylinder engine delivers its maximum torque of 200 Nm from 2,000 rpm.DesignThe sixth generation Polo is the first one based on the modular transverse matrix (MQB) platform.This offers the ability to create significantly more dynamic proportions with a long wheelbase, short body overhangs and a sporty ratio of its key dimensions (longer, wider, lower overall height but improved headroom). ExteriorLike the Golf, Touran, Tiguan, Passat and Arteon, the Polo is now also based on the modular transverse matrix (MQB). Here the A0 version is adapted for particularly compact models. Thanks to the use of MQB A0, comfort gains have also been made courtesy of the 92mm longer wheelbase, optimised entry and exit for rear seating and overall package improvements.The car has an increased boot size that does not compromise on rear occupant space, which has also improved with great rear leg room. The design team took advantage of these realigned dimensions to put a sporty, powerful, fresh and masculine Polo onto wheels of up to 18 inches in size.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425785-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lexus reveals LF-1 Limitless flagship crossover" width="120" height="120">Lexus reveals LF-1 Limitless flagship crossoverLexus has revealed its Lexus LF-1 Limitless - a concept that debuts a new genre of luxury vehicle, the flagship crossover...18 Jan 2018The dynamic effects of the MQB A0 on the proportions are reflected in the Polo's new dimensions. The length of the compact Volkswagen has grown by 81mm to 4,053mm, and its wheelbase has also been lengthened by 81mm to 2,548mm. This means that the wheels are now positioned further to the front and rear, which also shortens the overhangs and gives the car a more powerful and sportier appearance. At the same time, the Polo is now 69mm wider and has an overall width of 1,751mm. Its height has been reduced by 8mm to 1,461mm.The headlights are now also available with LED technology. Together with the radiator grille, they form the new 'face' of the Polo that extends across the entire vehicle width. The new trapezoidal-shaped tail lights are worked into the shoulder section (optionally available as LED tail light clusters for the first time). The new diffuser is now integrated into the bumper.InteriorAlmost all the interior elements in the sixth generation Polo have been newly-designed. New for this generation of Polo, this dashpad is offered with different coloured trims. Two dashpad coloured trims are available; Limestone Grey Metallic on the Trendline and Comfortline and Deep Iron Metallic on Highline.The newly-developed horizontal dashboard design focuses on the driver; for example, the dashboard and the centre console are slightly angled. All key modules are located on one visual axis, creating a coherent digital cockpit landscape.The new Polo comes in ten exterior colours; Pure White, Flash Red, Dark Petrol, Reflex Silver Metallic,  Limestone Grey Metallic, Pale Copper, Reef Blue, Energetic Orange, Deep Black Pearl Effect and White Silver Metallic.Interior colours and instrument panel decors are offered in the following coloursâ€™ Limestone Grey metallic, Deep Iron metallic, Velvet Red and Reef Blue.Keep an eye out for our review of the new Polo, up on Bizcommunity soon.
