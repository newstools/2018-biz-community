There’s no denying 2017 was one for the books for Black Bean Productions. As these commercial and documentary film gurus strive to make a difference through their work, it made all the business sense in the world for them to contribute to Ogilvy & Mather Africa’s The World's Most Eligible Bachelor work for Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy.  The resulting Tinder-type ad garnered two million Tinder swipes in 190 countries and raised $160,000 dollars in donations in just a week.Amongst others, this innovative conservation communication was further recognised with headlines on CNN, the BBC and Al-Jazeera, as well as 30 awards at the 2017 African Cristal Awards Festival alone, which rewards the best advertising campaigns created and broadcasted over the African continent, on any media.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1705/392703-120x120.jpg" alt="The Most Eligible Bachelor” campaign from Ogilvy Africa for OL Pejeta Conservancy." width="120" height="120">Agencies shine at African Cristal Festival 2017Agencies shine at African Cristal Festival 2017, held over the weekend, with Ogilvy Africa named Best Agency on the continent...17 May 2017Internationally, it scooped up three coveted Cannes Lions 2017 awards, roaring proud with a bronze Media Lion, bronze ‘Promo and Activation Lion, and a bronze ‘Health and Wellness’ Lion.Creative conservation communicationThe work was also highlighted across the continent at the relaunched Kenyan APA Awards, as a prime example of how creatives can successfully target digital and social media by taking a different approach – in this case, instead of making the subject of rhino conservation sad and serious, they made it interactive and fun.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/421362-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The World’s Most Eligible Bachelor campaign." width="120" height="120">APA results: Kenya's thriving advertising industryThe fastest and most affordable connectivity in sub-Saharan Africa enables Kenya to punch well above its weight in the IT sector generally...4 Dec 2017The quality collaborative work also resulted in a raft of Loeries across various five categories: Ranging from ‘media innovation - single medium’ gold to ‘PR and media communication’ campaign silver, as well as ‘integrated campaign’ bronze, ‘digital and interactive – social media’ bronze, and a ‘digital crafts - use of technology’ craft certificate. As a result, Black Bean Productions took fifth spot in the digital agency/production company Loeries Rankings 2017 table, based on the Loeries’ ‘digital and interactive communication’ category.This was definite cause for lots of celebration, as it marks the first year that Black Bean Productions has been recognised by the Loeries. The team says, “It has been an honour to receive our first nomination and hopefully there will be more to come.”While they like to collaborate with freelancers, which keeps their content innovative, their core team comprises producer Sam Suter; director James Suter; director and director of photography/DOP Oli Caldow; and production coordinator Diana Nkambule.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425581-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Team Black Bean Productions." width="625" height="325">Team Black Bean Productions.I caught up with Black Bean Productions’ core team to find out how they plan to extend their winning streak this year and who they admire most in the industry… .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you attribute this year’s successes to?
