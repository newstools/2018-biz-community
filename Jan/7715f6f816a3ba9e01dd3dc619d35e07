I’m excited and looking forward to celebrating the event with all my fans”, said Bonang. Commenting on Bonang’s partnership with the event, Grand White CEO, Stephan Dau says: “The Grand White Dinner welcomes everyone. All we ask is that guests dress in all white. The most important purpose for our event however, is to bring people together.
