Vertical markets within the discipline include Over-the-Counter, Dietary Supplements/Nutraceuticals, OTC Products & Equipment, Prescription/Pharmaceuticals, Health Services, Awareness/Advocacy/Education/Fundraising and Business-to-Business.  “This new jury consists of esteemed creative professionals from around the world who specialize in this unique field where work often needs to pass both creative and regulatory muster,” said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club for Creativity. “Health, wellness and pharma continue to be fast-growing segments with their own unique regulatory challenges, and the creative work deserves to be judged by a separate dedicated jury of advertising experts.”He added the quality of creative work in these areas has advanced significantly in recent years. “Soon after launching One Show Rx in 2000 as the ad industry’s first awards show for pharma, we recognised much of the work was not yet up to One Show Pencil standards and rolled the discipline back into the overall One Show four years later,” said Swanepoel. “Today, health wellness and pharma deserve to be a separate discipline again due to the elevated quality of the work.”The One Show judging takes place in March 2018, with finalists announced in April in the lead up to the The One Show awards ceremonies on 9 and 11 May 2018 during Creative Week in New York.Entries can be submitted via OneShow.org.
