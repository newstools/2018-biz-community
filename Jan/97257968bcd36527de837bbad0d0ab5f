Influence is the way we affect others and more importantly how we persuade people in a way with a positive outcome. Stephane concentrated on discussing the impact of women in influencer marketing, analysing the impact of consumer purchasing decisions, and how those decisions are reached. Word of mouth has a tremendous reach, and statistics show that women are the primary decision-makers. A staggering 68% of social media influencers are women. Authenticity of messaging drives engagement and ultimately consumer buying. 71% of consumers’ purchasing decisions are influenced by social media references. He demonstrated that moms represent a staggering $2.4-trillion market, and that 54% of women show brand love and support. With women on social media more frequently daily, they are dominating influencer marketing. Future Females is a platform that connects, inspires and supports existing and aspiring female entrepreneurs. The challenge:  Globally, female entrepreneurs received just 2.5% of total venture capital funding in 2016.  However, companies delivered 63% better return with females in senior leadership positions.  Globally, women own just 1% of the world’s wealth.  In South Africa in 2015 just 6.2% of South African women were involved in entrepreneurship, down from 9% the year before. Future Females believe that to drive change through technology, they cannot have just 50% of the world focused on it. More focus is needed to encourage and accelerate the success of aspiring and existing female entrepreneurs. Providing an environment, both physically and emotionally, where women can connect with others and access key resources (mentorship, funding, education) is key to accelerating the rate of female entrepreneurship, in South Africa, Africa and globally.
