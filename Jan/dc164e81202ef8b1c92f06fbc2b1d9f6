Other institutions that have committed themselves to the rights offer are PSG Asset Management, Prudential Investment Managers, and state financier Industrial Development Corporation (IDC).Monday's statement reminded shareholders that Basil Read had fallen into an interim loss of R474m for the six months to end-June from a R74m profit in the matching period due to numerous loss-making projects.Basil Read said besides raising capital, its turnaround strategy included cutting headcount and fixing and closing distressed contracts.Source: BDpro
