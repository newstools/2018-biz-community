As a first step, 170 tonnes of carrot, 50 tonnes of cabbage, 15 tonnes of cauliflower, and 30 tonnes of beans will be imported over several weeks so as to prevent shortage on the local market.Minister Seeruttun highlighted that the meeting aimed at preparing a plan to help planters whose fields have been damaged. The final plan will be presented at a special cabinet meeting for approval. He pointed out that some 75 % of the local vegetable production was affected by the heavy rains and that it will take about three months for the situation to return to normal.With regards to some 6,000 planters who have incurred net losses, it has been suggested that the Development Bank of Mauritius provides them with loans so that they can rehabilitate their fields and acquire quality seeds to restart the production of vegetables and promote the local agriculture, the minister underscored. This financing plan, as announced in Budget speech 2017-2018, is in the process of being finalised, he added.Seeruttun also underlined that his ministry is working on a new insurance plan which will be more attractive and will encourage more planters to benefit from it.Read the original article on Government of Mauritius.
