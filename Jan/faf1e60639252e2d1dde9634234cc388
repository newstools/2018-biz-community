Its CEO Ben Magara and the board had unveiled a strategy of selling spare capacity in its concentrators, smelters and refinery, selling non-core assets and bringing partners into a number of key projects that Lonmin simply could not afford but had to develop.The strategy forced the hand of Sibanye, which would have preferred to wait a year or two longer before launching its all-share bid for Lonmin. Sibanye has grown into one of the world's largest platinum producers since listing in 2013.The Lonmin assets give Sibanye the processing facilities it wanted so that it could take control of its destiny and sell refined platinum group metals from SA, instead of processing metal through offtake and toll treatment agreements with Anglo American Platinum.Lonmin's shares were trading 3% higher at R15.18 each by mid-afternoon on Thursday.
