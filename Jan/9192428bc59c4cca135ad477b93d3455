Initially we will focus on upskilling and growing our people – fulfilling the founding purpose of our agency – with the long-term view to extending this service externally, to graduates, clients and other selected industry learners,” said Lebo Masilela, Group Human Resources Director at Joe Public United.More than simply a training company offering a selection of courses, the School of Growth is built on the understanding that industry professionals need to fully comprehend and absorb their learnings, promoting and enabling sustained growth through ongoing coaching and assessment. Coaches are trained, skilled and accredited with a passion for assisting and growing others. “Using coaches that are Joe Publicans, means that our people are supported by coaches who are equipped with full knowledge of the environment and culture they operate within, resulting in a fertile and holistic growth approach,” added Masilela.“School of Growth brings all of our values together to actualise our second pillar of growth, namely the exponential growth of our people. It is my deepest belief that human growth surpasses the development of only the intelligent quotient, and that the development of the emotional and spiritual quotients are critical to  growing effective, creative beings” added Pepe Marais, Group Chief Creative Officer, Joe Public United. “Growth is in itself a creative process, the School of Growth is a big idea that will ripple across our business from the inside out.”
