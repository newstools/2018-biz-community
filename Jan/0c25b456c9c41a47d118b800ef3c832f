Carmen Schaefer, creative head of department commented, “Diversity is not just about what happens in the classroom. It opens the playing field for different perspectives; it encourages open minds and curiosity and builds a solid, inclusive foundation for different cultures, socio-economic backgrounds and passions. It is a non-negotiable for Red & Yellow to have bursary students; education is the only true way we’re going to impact the future of the next-gen workforce.” “Part of our mission is to provide a free, private tertiary education experience for as many students as possible in order to truly impact our society and support our mission: to teach the great creators, inventors, leaders and entrepreneurs of the 21st Century. We are a better business school because we are filled with all students from all walks of life,” comments Wesley Fredericks, MD of Red & Yellow.
