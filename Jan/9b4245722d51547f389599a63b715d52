The fourth in a chain of Plan B Dessertery stores to open, The Zone @ Rosebank branch is the first to hit Joburg. “We’re really excited to introduce this fun concept to Jo’burg,” says Carla Fitton, franchisee for Plan B Dessertery, The Zone @ Rosebank. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425287.jpg" alt="Plan B Dessertery opens in Joburg" width="600" height="387">Patrons to Plan B Dessertery will appreciate the conscious approach to fresh, delicious produce and local suppliers, explains Fitton. “We take extra care to make sure that each and every bubble waffle, churro or taco is perfection. Each day, we carefully check batters, mixtures and machines to serve only the best quality desserts.”The dessert brand also offers a unique coffee blend from Terbodore Coffee, which is 100% Arabica from Brazil, Uganda and Ethiopia. The blend is roasted in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands especially for Plan B Dessertery.
