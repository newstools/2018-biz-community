“We love you forever,” Fish wrote. “Thank you!”The issue? The attached image was one of Fish with Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse, who is still “very much alive”. Fish deleted the tweet, apologised, and posted a picture of the real Masekela, but not before Twitter latched on with the #MarkFishChallenge.  In rushed a variety of mislabeled images for a meme so strong it stayed trending at the nation’s top spot well into Thursday morning.    Mark Fish himself got in on the action, retweeting some of his favourites. Props to Fish for taking the mistake on the chin — and for bringing some light to the sad loss of Hugh Masekela.
