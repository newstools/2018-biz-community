He said that management of the iconic V&A Waterfront intended to operate the terminal building as a multi-use facility, which would bring year-round activity. “Without a doubt, the cruise line industry offers enormous potential for tourism growth, and therefore the extension of the V&A Waterfront experience to the cruise terminal will hold the key to prosperity,” said Vos. The rise in SA cruise bookingCruises International’s Seymour Brugger said: “With the upsurge in cruise bookings out of South Africa, it’s no surprise that luxury cruise liners are enticing more and more customers to enjoy the incredible benefits and experiences that they offer.“Unlike many of the large cruise liners that take thousands of passengers, luxury liners provide guests with the opportunity to have freedom of space, indulgent food experiences and the opportunity to visit intimate ports, many of which are not accessible by the larger cruise vessels. The five and six-star experiences vary, although they all have one thing in common – service that you can feel. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426680-625x325.jpg?1" alt="Crystal Symphony, Seabreeze Penthouse Suite.

Freedom to enjoy facilities and excursions without the crowds, a luxury cruise will offer clients all the space, time and the very best in service.” Vos further reiterated that it was vital that South Africa encouraged the growth of cruise ship tourism, pointing out that a 2011 City of Cape Town report found that cruise ships carrying around 2,000 passengers result in spending to the value of R2.2m per day.The Crystal Symphony will take in Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Richards Bay, Maputo, Taolanaro in Madagascar, Reunion and Port Louis in Mauritius in the first leg of its world cruise.
