Ideal tool through which to review successAgencies and their clients are invited to enter their best work into the 2018 Apex Awards. In an era where budgetary cuts are prevalent and resulting in agencies being placed under extreme pressure, the Awards programme is an ideal tool through which to review success. Winning an award allows marketers to justify increased budget allocation while providing agencies with the ability to highlight the value they add to client business objectives and the resultant bottom line. “With respect to budget allocation for advertising and communications expenses, spend is an investment rather than an expense. The Apex Awards reflects this through providing proof of how advertising and communications campaigns have the ability to deliver measured and effective returns on that particular investment,” explains Odette van der Haar, ACA CEO.As evidenced by past Awards entries, the standard for the Apex Awards finalists is set extremely high and will not be compromised. Entrants are required to submit case studies detailing their campaigns, ensuring that the isolation of the effects of the marketing communications is clearly detailed. This is key in systematically proving to the highly experienced and respected Apex judging panel a case for the campaign itself as being the cause for the brand success. The three Apex categories into which campaigns may be entered are:1. LaunchFor brands or services that are less than 12 months old with no significant history of advertising.2. ChangeFor new campaigns from previously advertised brands that resulted in significant short-term effects on sales and/or behaviour – short-term being within a period of no more than 18 months.3. SustainFor campaigns that benefited a business by maintaining or strengthening a brand over a long period, i.e. 36 months.“We encourage all agencies and their clients, to enter their most effective work into the 2018 Apex Awards. Entry is open to all agencies, whether an ACA member or not. We are looking forward to another year of showcasing the value our industry adds to commercial brand success,” concludes van der Haar.
