With a clear, bold vision, Mfundo allows the audience to live through each character's experience to bring the emotion of the message alive: getting rich suddenly is jolly exciting. The result is a fast, light, upbeat product delivered with simple, comedic elegance and Mfundo's trademark dash of pluckiness.
