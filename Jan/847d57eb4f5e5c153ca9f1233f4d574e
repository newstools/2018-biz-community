We almost didn’t visit the mountain today, and how very lucky that we did,” said Andrew.The Cableway’s Managing Director Wahida Parker said the latest million took only 12 months to achieve, owing to consistent visitor numbers throughout 2017. “In reaching this milestone, we are privileged to celebrate being successful custodians of such an iconic attraction,” said Parker. “This is a moment in which we also acknowledge the dedication of each member or our Cableway team, without whom we would not be able to welcome the millions of visitors over the years.”    “There is something wonderful about being able to witness the excitement and awe that so many of our visitors experience when summiting Table Mountain. Looking ahead, we hope to continue to facilitate a world-class experience that allows many more people, especially locals, to make lasting memories atop South Africa’s New 7 Wonder of Nature.”
