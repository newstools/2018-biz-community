I don’t think so. Here are five ways to ensure that your digital marketing efforts survive the shift:1. Diversify your platforms and mediumsSmart marketers have been doing this for ages. Make sure you have a presence on either Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn or any other social platforms that are suitable for your business. Find ways to continuously grow your email database and look to alternate mediums like WhatsApp and bulk SMS. The only people who are really going to struggle with the latest update are brands and small businesses who have put all their eggs in the Facebook basket.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425676.jpg" alt="(c) Vadim Ginzburg -" width="625" height="417">(c) Vadim Ginzburg - 123RF.com2. Expand your influencer marketing strategyBloggers and social influencers have just scored a big win. How are you working with them to share your brand messaging and content? Have you budgeted for an influencer strategy? Now is a good time to start negotiating terms as these costs are sure to rise in the coming months. It’s also time to start asking yourself how you can incentivise your customers to share authentic endorsements of your brand. It's important to note that Facebook has already begun to penalise ‘engagement baiting’ posts, e.g. “Like this if you’re an Aries” or “Share with friends to win a free trip”.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425668.png" alt="What the Zuck? How to adjust your digital marketing strategy after Facebook's announcement" width="625" height="440">3. Incorporate Facebook groupsThe ability to link Facebook groups to brand pages has offered marketers an excellent way to engage with their audiences without the usual algorithm constraints – if you can offer them a value proposition that makes joining your group worthwhile. Groups do require a lot of work, but if you can build a ‘tribe’ around authentic and useful content, you’ve got yourself a winner. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425299-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Alexander Kirch -" width="120" height="120">Facebook move will play out in long-term: analystsNEW YORK - Facebook's move to highlight posts from friends and family over those from brands and publications follows months of turmoil for the social network and will result in lower advertising revenue - at least in the short-term, analysts said...2 days ago4. Increase your Facebook ads budgetDespite 'the Zuck’s' altruistic reasons for the algorithm change, Facebook does have shareholders to keep happy. The cost of Facebook advertising has steadily increased over the last year and it is sure to do the same in the coming months as brands spend more money on boosting content. I am still surprised that many brands and small businesses are willing to spend big money on content, but not on promoting it to reach the right audience. What a waste of time and money.5. Hire great content creators and strategistsAverage content is no longer going to cut it. Hiring your web development company to manage your Facebook page is unlikely to do you any favours. Invest in content creators that have proven experience in their respective mediums (video, graphic design, copywriting) and don’t be afraid to explore edgy and creative campaigns. Place a stronger emphasis on creativity and innovation within your marketing teams. You’re going to have to create content that really stands out!To quote John Lennon, “Everything will be ok in the end. And if it’s not ok, it’s not the end.” Review your current strategies and habits and make some well-thought-out adjustments – and you can look forward to continued digital marketing success. But it ain’t going to be as easy as it used to be!
