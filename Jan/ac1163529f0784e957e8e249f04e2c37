We also received calls (on Tuesday afternoon) about the glitches. This is why the deputy minister is going to the centres to understand what issues are there and ensure that these issues are resolved," she said.The system is expected to be under immense pressure following the agreement reached by Universities South Africa (USAF) and the department to allow walk-ins and late applications by prospective students. However, the organisation said queuing in the sun was not the recommended approach and referred applicants to the central online application system.USAF CEO Ahmed Bawa said the organisation was not aware of the technical problems. USAF has said the system is a reliable means of ensuring that students are matched with available spaces.Source: The Times
