More than one proposal is expected to be accepted at this stage, the government said. A further AUS$1m will then be made available to the best solutions at the proof of concept stage, where applicants develop and test their prototypes for up to 12 months. Those that are successful will retain intellectual property rights and will be able to try to commercialise their innovation.UNESCO's World Heritage Committee last year decided not to place the Barrier Reef on its list of sites "in danger" despite concern over the mass coral bleaching. The 2017 bleaching marked the second-straight year that corals have been damaged by warming sea temperatures, an unprecedented occurrence that scientists said would give the invertebrate marine creatures insufficient time to fully recover.Coral reefs make up less than one percent of Earth's marine environment, but are home to an estimated 25% of ocean life, acting as nurseries for many species of fish.Source: AFP
