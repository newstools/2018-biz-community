Talks are at a sensitive stage, according to three informed sources.Last week, Koko was replaced by Willy Majoa as interim head of generation, a move Eskom said was "a mutual agreement" for Koko "to settle in". Two senior government officials outside Eskom, however, confirmed there were plans to remove Koko within days.The practice of paying officials suspected of corruption to go rather than face charges has been a common feature under President Jacob Zuma's administration. How the ANC's new leadership responds to a generous deal with Koko will be a key indicator of whether it intends to get tough on corruption.The talks with Koko started last week, according to the sources.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1712/423146.jpg" alt="Matshela Koko off the hook, back in driving seat at Eskom" width="120" height="120">Matshela Koko off the hook, back in driving seat at EskomEskom acting CE Matshela Koko has been found not guilty on all charges in a disciplinary hearing...By Neo Goba and Kyle Cowan 18 Dec 2017Eskom failed to take disciplinary and criminal action against Koko, as recommended by independent forensic investigations in 2017 and its own forensic team. If any separation deal involved Eskom paying monies to Koko, the Treasury and the public enterprises minister would have to approve it.At least three forensic investigations into corruption recommended that Eskom lay criminal charges against Koko and five other executives and senior managers, as well as subjecting them to a disciplinary processes for their role in facilitating a R1.6bn illegal payment to global consultancy McKinsey and the politically connected consultancy Trillian - which was majority-owned by Gupta family associate Salim Essa at the time. In an August 2017 forensic report, commissioned by Eskom after media and public outrage, law firm Bowmans recommended that the utility charge Koko, chief finance officer Anoj Singh, former head of procurement Edwin Mabelane, acting head of group capital Prish Govender, senior procurement manager Charles Kalima and Maya Naidoo (or Bhana) for their role in the illegal deal with McKinsey.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424141-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Matshela Koko" width="120" height="120">Govender and Koko back at Eskom - but they're not out of the water yetEskom's acting head of group capital Prish Govender returned to work on Tuesday while the head of generation Matshela Koko is scheduled to do so on Monday next week after both were cleared of wrongdoing by internal disciplinary processes and reinstated late last year....By Linda Ensor 3 Jan 2018Eskom also admitted it did not have a contract with Trillian and was not aware of any services provided by the firm. Eskom's own internal forensic unit recommended disciplinary procedures against those implicated in the payments to Trillian and McKinsey. G9 Forensic Consulting arrived at a similar conclusion in its report, also commissioned by Eskom, as did US management consultancy Oliver Wyman.In a report commissioned by Tokyo Sexwale, former chairman of Trillian, advocate Geoff Budlender called the McKinsey/Trillian arrangement at Eskom "a sham". Koko was not charged for his role in facilitating the illegal payment.It emerged in January that the National Prosecuting Authority's asset-forfeiture unit had obtained a preservation order to freeze McKinsey's and Trillian's assets in order to secure and to recover the R1.6bn. This, however, is a civil case that seeks to safeguard stolen property against loss, while a criminal leg may be instituted at a later stage.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425716-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo: clbEurope.com" width="120" height="120">McKinsey strongly denies corruption allegations concerning Eskom and Trillian point by pointGlobal consultancy McKinsey has strongly denied allegations that it was involved in corrupt efforts to milk Eskom of hundreds of millions of rand...By Linda Ensor 1 day agoKoko's position as head of the utility's generation unit became untenable after he was suspended in May 2017, following numerous allegations of conflict of interest in which he was accused of irregularly awarding more than R1bn in contracts to a company in which his stepdaughter, Koketso Choma, owned shares.He was also accused of irregularly removing some colleagues from their positions at the Kusile power station. Koko was found not guilty and reinstated in January after almost eight months on suspension.Asked detailed questions about the negotiations and the legality of any proposed golden handshake, Eskom skirted the questions, instead only confirming Koko's "current status" as an employee.In October, Eskom's legal head Suzanne Daniels issued a letter of demand to McKinsey and Trillian to pay back the money - she was suspended two days later. McKinsey has since offered to repay the money, while Trillian denies any wrongdoing.Bizarrely, Eskom on Wednesday changed its tune on the Mckinsey and Trillian deal: "The investigation into Mckinsey and Trillion (sic) was done by a senior council (sic) and they found the contract was valid, hence Prish Govender's suspension was lifted."
