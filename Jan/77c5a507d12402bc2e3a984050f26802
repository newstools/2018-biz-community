We invite all journalists who specialise in reporting on energy or water affairs to either nominate themselves or for news and industry organisations to put forward their top choice for the journalist that has covered the sector in an innovative yet objective manner. The category is open to media across the continent.”Another exciting new category in the African Utility Week Industry Awards is the Digital Utility Award. “The African utility of the future is likely to be a fully digital system,” says Evan Schiff, “entrants for this award are utilities and solution providers who are leading the disruption in the market, maximising utility profitability and adapting business models in the evolving digital environment.”The deadline for entries is 2 March 2018.
