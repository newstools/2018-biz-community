“The Superhero Tour has been one of The Color Run’s favourite themes,” says Trevor Latimer, national event coordinator, South Africa.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426790-625x486.jpg" alt="Color Run South Africa's final superhero tour kicks off in Stellenbosch" width="625" height="486">Have fun, do goodWith over 11,500 Color runners participating in the Superhero Tour in Cape Town, The Color Run was able to raise a donation of R 85,000 which will go to a charity in the greater Cape Town area, thanks to the generosity of headline sponsor Capitec Bank. “Capitec’s sponsorship of this amazing event was not only based on its ability to bring together the diverse communities of South Africa, but also because it has allowed us to give back to the communities which support us.” says Francois Viviers, executive of marketing and communications at Capitec Bank.“The Color Run enables our superheroes to have fun, while doing good. With its clearly defined ethos, we feel it’s the perfect partner for Heart FM,” says Marlo Paulse head of marketing for Heart FM – media sponsor for The Color Run, Stellenbosch.While the start gun goes off at 8am, Color runners are encouraged to get to Hoërskool Stellenbosch early to soak up the vibe and get warmed up. The route takes most people between one and two hours to complete. Then, Color runners can get ready for the world-famous Finish Festival, which will have you jumping for joy in rainbow clouds of colour.What heroes are made ofThe Color Run’s Superhero Tour acknowledges all the characteristics that define us as heroes. And, it applauds those nearest and dearest to us, and those further afield who inspire us and offer themselves as role models.“Not only are we encouraging participants to celebrate themselves, and those who have mentored, cheered for, and positively influenced them, but this season, we’re sending a #TCRHero to The Color Run in Paris,” says Latimer.Latimer encourages existing and would be superheroes to start compiling their stories for sharing, consider their charities, and fly over to www.thecolorrun.co.za for more information on The Superhero Tour and the competition rules.As always, The Color Run is a devoted #WaterWarrior, and encourages all Color runners to get on board. We are committed to dry clean ups, and can help you get clean with a minimal amount of water.
