This bolstered our decision to host a regional leg of the show in Africa.” Entries are now open locally, and applicants can upload their submissions via the website, http://africa.ciclopefestival.com. The jury panel is formed by a selection of local and global talents, including Alistair King (King James), Amy Allais (Ola! Films), Ralph Laucella (O Positive, US), Trish Russell (AMV BBDO, UK), Debra Stubbs (Groundglass), Kim Geldenhuys (0307), Yash Deb (Isobar, Kenya) and Antoine Bagot (Ogilvy Paris, France), among others. The final round of judging and the awards ceremony will take place at Cape Town’s new critically acclaimed contemporary art museum, Zeitz MOCCA, on Tuesday, 10 April 2018. “Zeitz MOCCA was the natural choice for Ciclope Africa, as its values – promoting creativity and intercultural understanding through elevating artists – so closely align with our own. Ciclope Africa’s Grand Prix and best works in each category will receive an automatic entry as finalists into the flagship annual festival, which will be hosted in Berlin later this year. Condorelli mentions that for the past eight years, Ciclope has provided a platform for directors, creatives, artists, producers and brands to celebrate exceptional work, share knowledge and be inspired, “and we are excited to turn the world’s attention to African talent, which has been largely underrepresented on the global stage.” “Our aim is to celebrate and elevate this talent through the Ciclope platform; exclusively dedicated to promoting excellence in craft, and with awarding categories such as Cinematography, Animation, Production Design, and more.” Ciclope Africa is part of a series of regional events that will continue on May 2018 with Ciclope Latino, to take place in Mexico City. The festival’s programme will also feature exhibitions, panel discussions, and renowned local and international guest speakers, as well as showcase some of the leading international trends.
