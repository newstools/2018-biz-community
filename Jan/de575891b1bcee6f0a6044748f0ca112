Mangena's 77-year-old grandmother Nita, who looked after him in Bulawayo in his younger years, could barely contain her excitement and ran onto the stage, stealing the show with her own dance moves.The four coaches: Sir Tom Jones, will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson and Olly Murs, then proceeded to battle over who gets to train the young talent, with will.i.am finally managing to persuade the teen to join his team after both he and Hudson compared their careers and awards in order to impress.Viewers flocked to Twitter to hail Mangena, praising him for his electrifying blind audition with one fan claiming: “Here is the winner of The Voice UK 2018. Everyone can go home now. It’s all over.”And it seems bookies are willing to get behind the singer too, offering solid odds for Mangena to scoop a record deal. “Donel stole the show on the return of The Voice and has attracted a flurry of bets to win the series where he is sure to be in the mix come the live shows,” said a leading UK bookmaker.Mangena told The Voice UK producers that his dad is his inspiration and that the father-and-son duo have a studio at their house. Mangena's father is Bulawayo-born musician and composer Nkosana Mangena, who is also known as Mangesto.Who is in Team https://t.co/wZKEIpzktW on The Voice UK?
