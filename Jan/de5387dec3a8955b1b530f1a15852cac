This was the first time the group brand released a TV commercial. The concept and script, penned by Botha: let's show our gratitude by making every one of our staff employee of the month. To make the commercial as authentic and sincere as possible, real staff from the various stores were featured doing what they do every day. Their natural responses to being told they are all being made employee of the month gives the commercial an engaging, unperformed feel. Says 9Point Creative Director and co-founder, Benoit Ruscoe: "We needed some magic. Yolande and Platon came through for us. Their inspiration and dedication to the job created a warm and sincere TVC that both the client and agency are very proud of.Â It was an absolute pleasure to work with a team that is so easy to get on with, positive and helpful." Award-winning DOP Felix Seuffert captured the intimate moments with the staff and created graphic, visually interesting compositions in the various stores. The commercial flighted on SABC in the last weeks of December 2017 when, during the festive season, their staff is under increased pressure. It was also shared internally, at all the stores, so that the staff can see themselves on screen.
