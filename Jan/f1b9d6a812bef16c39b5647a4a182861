H&M has apologised, saying that the incident is entirely a coincidence.According to Swedish state radio SVT, Petra Buchinger, a press officer at H&M said: “The print on the sock depicting a Lego figure, which looks like 'Allah' in Arabic, is entirely a coincidence, but because our customers have complained, we have chosen to recall the items.”“At H&M we always aim to offer products that we believe our customers will appreciate. The print on this sock represents a Lego figurine, any other meaning is coincidental and we apologise if this motif has offended anyone.”The recall comes weeks after the fast fashion retailer was accused of racism after it used a black boy to model a hoodie with the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle” printed on it. The incident sparked outrage on social media, leading to a number of South African stores being vandalised.H&M has since appointed company insider Annie Wu as "global leader for diversity and inclusiveness for H&M Group".<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424668-120x120.jpg?2" alt="H&amp;M removes 'black boy' ad after racism accusation" width="120" height="120">H&M removes 'black boy' ad after racism accusationSwedish clothing giant Hennes and Mauritz on Monday apologised and removed an advertisement of a black child after the company was accused of being racist...9 Jan 2018For more:H&M remove range of children's socks because pattern 'resembles Allah written in Arabic upside-down' weeks after 'monkey' hoodie controversyH&M in hot water again - this time over 'Allah' patterned socksH&M pull range of kids socks because it includes squiggle that looks like Allah written upside down in Arabic
