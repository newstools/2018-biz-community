The millennial of today is sure to find a Barbie doll to fit their current personal identity, without the social guilt of conforming to Original Barbie’s very un-PC, white, blond, hetro-normal aesthetic.)The entertainment industry has been quick to cash-in on this backwards-looking trend. Turn on Netflix, and you will be bombarded by re-runs of 1990’s television favourites ready for you to binge-watch, including The Fresh Prince of Belair, and the not-very-politically-correct-at-all-by-today's-standards, Friends.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1708/408760.jpg" alt="The role of digital marketing in a millennial's world" width="120" height="120">The role of digital marketing in a millennial's worldPreviously, the more advertisements you threw at the younger generation, the earlier you got them to purchase your brand.

The catch is, the programme only runs when installed on a specific 80’s computer.On the other side of the cultural spectrum, Bruno Mars’ latest music videos borrow heavily from the big-caps, baggy-pants and bright colour look and feel of the early 1990’s.Sooth your inner millennial childIf re-living your childhood through a screen is not enough, other businesses around the world are now offering adult sleepover parties and bedtime stories to soothe your inner millennial child through their pre-midlife crisis:Bedtime Stories For Grown-Ups by Ben Holden is an anthology book of stories that seek to separate people from technology and re-engage them in the childhood bedtime ritual.The Astronights at the Science and Natural History Museum in the USA offers the opportunity to go behind the scenes of various collections on display in the museum before crawling into your sleeping bag for a slumber party with the rest of the visitors.WeWork, a co-working space provider, hosts weekend-long adult summer camps for its employees and the members who rent its spaces.So, the question now is, what childhood comforts could your brand offer millennials to escape from the stresses and pressures of “adulting”?
