How it worksGreg Saffy, MD of UTi Distribution explains how it works: “When ordering online, shoppers simply select the ByBox delivery option to their nearest locker at selected Engen service stations.”Parcels are dispatched the next day, and drivers scan them in at the selected ByBox terminal. The correct one opens automatically, and an SMS is sent to the customer with the delivery location and a PIN number to access the locker.Customers can also send parcels from and Engen service station via DSV ByBox, he explains. “Simply buy a DSV PAK from an associated retailer and package it, complete the dispatch note, scan it in at a ByBox terminal and follow the touch screen instructions to put it in the designated locker.”According to Seelan Naidoo, Engen’s general manager: retail, the trend towards buy and collect has gained momentum. “Engen is excited to be a part of this innovative journey. Together with DSV we are bringing an alternative, user-friendly delivery solution to the South African market.”
