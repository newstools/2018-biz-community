Some of the songs we already had a basic layout of, some we worked from scratch, with me coming up with lyrics while Jason was laying down drums and guitars, etc., and others were unique - like Best Smile was born in Bellville Studio's backyard. All in all, it took about a year to record and was split between two producers – Theo Crous and Dane Taylor – in Cape Town and Johannesburg.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426158-625x417.jpg" alt="Image by Christelle Duvenhage" width="625" height="417">Image by Christelle Duvenhage.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}If you had to describe this album as a meal, what would it be and why?This album would be a stew because it’s hot, heavy, and good for you..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why the title Snakes & Ladders?I find the board game pretty close to real life. We’re all on this same path, everyone is trying to overtake the next to get to some or other end. Sometimes we strike a luck and ‘move up the ladder’, sometimes we get unlucky and ‘slide down the snake’. At the end of the day, we’re all just really rolling the dice and hoping for the best.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426159-625x625.jpg" alt="Lost&amp;Found chat new album" width="625" height="625">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your favourite track and why?My favourite track is Best Smile because it’s the most personal for me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your guilty pleasure when it comes to music?I don’t have guilty pleasures. If I like something then I’m not ashamed to admit it. I do love listening to Classic FM every chance I get though, does that count?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s the best and worst things about being South African musicians?I think our country being so small is both a blessing and a curse when it comes to being SA musos. The country can be toured relatively quickly. In America, you don’t even have to leave your state to have a full-time career in music. Here it’s a lot more difficult. People lose interest quickly, if you’re lucky enough to get their attention in the first place. It’s a tough market and there are not many bands that are lucky enough to do music full-time, however, we live in a beautiful country, and touring SA is always an awesome experience..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your favourite emoji?Probably the cactus..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next for the band?We start our Snakes & Ladders launch tour next week, so I think we had better get in a few rehearsals!Buy/Stream Snakes & Ladders on Apple Musicwww.facebook.com/wearelostandfoundsetTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
