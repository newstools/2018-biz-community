“The Garden Route is one of the world's great walking destinations; its incredible mountains, secret forests, cascading waterfalls, coastal cliffs, amazing beaches and famous trails are ideal for such a festival,” says festival founder Galeo Saintz.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425449-625x348.png" alt="All walks of life welcomed at Hi-Tec Garden Route Walking Festival" width="625" height="348">There are walks for everyone, including the Moonlight Meander as well as brisk hikes up the region’s highest peaks. Traditional walks include the Brown-Hooded Kingfisher Trail or Circles in the Forest Elephant Walk and, for the more intrepid, there is a Keurbooms to Nature’s Valley Walk. A collection of festive walks such as the Hi-Tec Coastal Pirates Treasure Hunt is perfect for Easter Sunday, or the Inner Magic walk for kids, both promise to be great fun with friends and family on Keurbooms Beach.The programme, of over 50 walks, includes many unusual walks, such as the Walk with Poetry, the Yoga Walk and the Sketching in the Nature walk. For those with an adventurous spirit, tough hikes along the rocky coast are a must. The community coastal clean-up walks are also expected to be a highlight in 2018.“The Garden Route Walking Festival is about building a connection between our diverse communities and between ourselves and wild nature,” says Saintz.The festival benefits local Garden Route environmental charities and conservation projects by showcasing their work and facilitating donations by walkers. The walks are all led by local volunteer walk leaders or professional walking guides who share their knowledge of the region.For more information about the Hi-Tec Garden Route Walking Festival go to www.walkingfestival.co.za.
