The low roofline and elevated ride height further emphasise that this is a crossover designed for performance with practicality.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425785-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Lexus reveals LF-1 Limitless flagship crossover" width="625" height="325">The spindle grille is a core element to the overall design. Details suggest that the start of the spindle forms at the rear of the vehicle, then continues forward toward the nose. The grille itself features a three-dimensional design with colours developed in-house by Calty. Ridges radiating away from the central emblem suggest magnetism guiding metal filings into shape. There is no chrome, as the LF-1 instead uses LED lighting around the grille that greets you on arrival.The Lexus LF-1 rear features a split roof spoiler and there are interesting curves and details along every inch of the rear fascia. The beautifully sculpted openings at each corner might look like exhaust pipes, but they're actually vents for the air coming past the rear wheels. The shoulders above those wheels provide sturdy mounts for the sculptural taillights that extend well past the metalwork. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424310-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2018: The car of just before tomorrow" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: The car of just before tomorrowThe car of tomorrow will be self-driving, will all but eliminate accidents, and will transform roads, cities and working lives. But that is a tomorrow that is still a decade or more away...By Arthur Goldstuck 8 Jan 2018Distracting analogue knobs and buttons have been removed from the cockpit in favour of motion-activated controls and a minimalist display directly ahead.Engaging the start button initiates a dramatic lighting sequence that differs depending on which of the several available driving modes is engaged. The wooden door trim has tiny perforations that allow indirect light from miniature LEDs to shine in a variety of colours that complement the more direct overhead lights.Technology enhances the luxurious feel of the car by expanding the options offered to the driver. It starts with the LF-1's Chauffeur mode, which allows for hands-free operation thanks to the vehicle's by-wire steering, braking, acceleration, lights, and signals. The result is smooth, carefree driving with maximum efficiency and reduced risk of accidents.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/424736-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Toyota to present next-generation automated driving research vehicle" width="120" height="120">Toyota to present next-generation automated driving research vehicleToyota's next-generation automated driving research vehicle, Platform 3.0, based on a Lexus LS 600h L, reportedly combines greater technological capabilities with harmonised styling...9 Jan 2018For engaged driving, all powertrain controls are on the steering wheel. Paddles mounted to the steering wheel control the transmission in manual mode for sporty driving while buttons on the lower section of the steering wheel engage standard drive mode options like park and reverse.There is also a four-dimensional navigation system which builds on traditional systems by adding the element of time to the equation. It acts as a concierge for the occupants by anticipating the needs of the driver and passengers based on the progress, traffic and road conditions along the programmed trip, suggesting fuel stops, rest breaks and restaurants, even offering to make hotel reservations. Touch-responsive haptic controls provide an interface with the 4D navigation system and integrated comfort and entertainment systems. A touch-tracer pad embedded in the leather-covered centre console supports character recognition for data entry. An additional haptic controller in the rear-seat centre console allows passengers to make their own comfort and entertainment choices.
