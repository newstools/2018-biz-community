Trends and Issues in National and Regional Economies,’ the conference will provide a platform to discuss global and local research in the cultural and creative industries and arts, culture and heritage sectors and explore some of the creative economy trends we are expecting to see in the next few years and beyond. “We have had an overwhelming response so far and look forward to receiving final abstracts before the deadline at the end of the month,” Haines added.The deadline for paper abstract submissions, presentations and panel discussions is Wednesday, 31 January at 5pm. Potential speakers can submit their abstracts and motivations online. The standard rate for the conference is R750 and R500 for students with early bird fees for those registering before 31 January.
