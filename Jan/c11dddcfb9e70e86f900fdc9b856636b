A champion’s journey from page to stage Every year, Top Media measures 1,000+ top South African companies against stringent people-, policies- and performance-based criteria, drawn up together with the University of Cape Town’s Development Policy Research Unit. 500 companies meeting these criteria qualify to list as the top five companies across 100 sectors, in the Top 500 publication. From there roughly 10% - the absolute elite among the best - go on to become awards finalists following a second round of even more intensive research, weighing heavily on growth and turnover. For more on the research process, contact Top Media Research Head Sandra.Bock@Topco.co.zabRev('brev-8b47dced-3741-481c-b007-2e76dab394de', '>a/\<az.oc.ocpoT@kcoB.ardnaS>"az.oc.ocpoT;46#&kcoB.ardnaS:otliam"=ferh a<'). Custodians of outstanding corporate management As at the time of writing, four companies have thrown their weight behind the awards’ manifesto (good business is great for the economy) as official Top 500 Sponsors. They are Award Sponsors TagIt, which shuttles jet-setting executives into the digital age through pioneering technology; Public Sector Manager magazine, which showcases excellence in public sector service delivery, and 52-years-strong BestMed - which is sponsoring a brand new category, The Workplace Wellness Award. Unlike the other qualification-based categories, finalists for this category will be selected through an entry and adjudication process. Entering companies must be listed in the latest Top 500 publication and submit a motivation detailing visionary workplace health and wellbeing initiatives.
