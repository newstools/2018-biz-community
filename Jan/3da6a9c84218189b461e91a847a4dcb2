Through awarding excellence in professional theatre, Fleur du Cap wine and the Theatre Awards have played a significant role in the lives of South African theatre-makers. “Theatre is the showcase for generations of artists; it is an honour to support such a pivotal part of the industry,” says SA brand manager for Premium Wines, Khanya Mashalaba.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/427203-625x418.jpg" alt="Renate Sturrman, Paul Slabolepszy, Charmaine-Weir Smith in Suddenly the Storm - photo by Eric Miller" width="625" height="418">Renate Sturrman, Paul Slabolepszy, Charmaine-Weir Smith in Suddenly the Storm - photo by Eric MillerWinners are chosen from productions performed at professional theatre venues in and around Cape Town. Theatre practitioners are recognised for acting, directing, staging, and technical ability. These nominations reflect the excellent theatre talent seen on stages throughout the Western Cape, last year. For the first time, awards will be made in the categories of Best Performance in an Opera (Male), Best Performance in an Opera (Female), Best Performance by an Ensemble, Best Theatre Production for Children and Young People, and Best Production.The awards are considered in 26 different categories, including for Lifetime Achievement and Innovation in Theatre. The latter will be announced at the ceremony, next month. The judges for the 2017 productions were Africa Melane, Dr Beverley Brommert, Eugene Yiga, Johan van Lill, Marina Griebenow, Maurice Carpede, Niel Roux, Tracey Saunders, and Wayne Muller.A total of 80 diverse productions from the year under review were eligible for consideration. The student panel adjudicated another 35 student productions, bringing the total number of productions that were considered in 2017 to 115.“The increased number of nominees in the category for Best New South African Script is extremely exciting as it means that local theatre-makers are becoming bolder in telling the stories that are at the heart of our collective lived experience. To see life imitating art in this way, is truly exhilarating. We thank Fleur du Cap wine brand, the hardworking panel of judges, theatre-makers and all the creatives behind the scenes who made this possible,” says Melanie Burke, chairman of the judging panel.Each award carries a cash prize of R15,000 and a silver medallion.
