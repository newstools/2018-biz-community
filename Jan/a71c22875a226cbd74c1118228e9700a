She is currently also doing her doctoral thesis on the differences and incidence of MDR-TB among adolescents versus adults. “It is a complicated picture, but we hope to unravel it to support better diagnostic tools and patient care,” she says.This type of research helps the National Health Laboratory Service and Department of Health in trying to refine TB diagnostic tools. “Until recently, it took up to two years to fine-tune treatment decisions for patients with MDR-TB. Patients get a cocktail of anti-TB drugs, but it takes time to find the right combination. Re-infection and relapse (patients stopping treatment for several reasons) add to the diagnostic and treatment management challenges,” says Van der Spoel van Dijk.“Now doctors can reduce the time needed for diagnostic certainty to about seven days, while new drugs allow reduction of treatment from more than 18 to nine months. This can have an enormous impact on the life of many patients.”
