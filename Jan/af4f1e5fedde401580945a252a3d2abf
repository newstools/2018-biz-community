On the mountain-side of Victoria Road, the luxury residential units start at 125m2, increasing to 600m2. Prices start at R15m for mountain-side apartments – going up to R130m for sea-facing apartments.The eight presidential residences each occupy their own floor, with private lift access, and when completed Aurum will feature details such as a cascading waterfall with gold hand-stitched mosaics for the logo, a reception area adorned with fine glass and crystal chandeliers, a luxurious spa, restaurant, 24-hour valet and concierge services, and landscaped grounds around a feature pool.Passion for art and beautyDa’Realty established its presence in the Western Cape three years ago when founding president Ahsan Darvesh fell in love with the beauty of Cape Town whilst studying for his MBA in the city, and made the decision to open a South African division of the family-owned property development company.At the time, Darvesh was staying at the then Ambassador Hotel, which was for sale, and this became the first acquisition for Da’Realty. “The Ambassador Hotel presented prime positioning, where all elements of nature presented themselves to be woven into the artistry of the building – a focus that is integral to Da’Realty’s ethos,” explains Darvesh, who has a deep and abiding passion for art and beauty – particularly in nature.“Aurum, when completed, will be an extremely exclusive, super-luxury work of art with exquisite finishes that are rarely seen in South Africa. The few privileged Aurum owners will be part of a private collection of art properties where every aspect has been carefully considered and each element is crafted by top artisans from around the world," says Darvesh.
