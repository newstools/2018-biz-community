We appeal for patience and cooperation in the interest of learners,” the provincial government said.As total of 2,565 of the 31,000 learners have been placed. Additionally a total of 4,500 new applications have been received since Saturday.“Unplanned financial implications of admitting late applicants are substantial. Additional funding will have to be found to finance educator salaries, additional classrooms, learning and teaching support materials and school furniture. Procurement processes are also not instant but can take weeks to complete,” the provincial government said.Parents that still have admission queries in relation to Grade 1 and 8 are advised to visit the admission centres. The centres will continue to operate until the end of January.Preparations for National Senior Certificate 2018The Gauteng Department of Education has opted to begin early with preparations for the National Senior Certificate in order to improve overall performance compared to 2017.
