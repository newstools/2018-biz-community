The stunt was well received as social and traditional media trended with the #JoziDivers tag. Onlookers were kept wondering what was going as they were desperately figuring out what the commotion and frenzy caused by the divers was all about. The aim of this scuba diver invasion was a teaser to the launch of Flying Fish’s new TV commercial; where the brand encourages South Africans to brew out the seriousness of their everyday mundane adulting habits, and brew in some play. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/427042-625x112.jpg" alt="Flying Fish brews out the serious of Monday and brews in some play with #JoziDivers" width="625" height="112">Post the #JoziDivers public stunt which alluded to the TVC’s storyline, the commercial was launched in the evening; featuring a scuba diver named Joey who is busy doing his mundane job - totally bored with his adulting situation. We then see Joey being saved form his boredom by a playful yellow submarine called The Flying Fish. The TV advert that was launched this past Monday is currently on high rotation on various TV channels across South Africa.
