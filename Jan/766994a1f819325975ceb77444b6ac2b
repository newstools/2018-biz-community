One of our greatest cost-side exposures is to the oil price and, by proxy, the rand or dollar exchange. Favourable trends in the local oil price are good for everyone because it means that competition will remain healthy, which in turn keeps costs down,” concludes Gordon.Despite predictions from the 2018 Global Travel Forecast, conducted by the GBTA Foundation in conjunction with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, which last year predicted that air travel would rise by as much as 7% in some regions across the world in 2018, FlySafair says that South Africans can continue to expect affordable domestic air ticket prices.
