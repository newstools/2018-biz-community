Stephen Richardson, chairman of Paarl Wine Route, explains that the wine route was a founding member of the Drakenstein Local Tourism Association, which was established in 2013 with the mandate to promote Paarl Tourism, Paarl Wine Route, Wellington Tourism and Wellington Wine Route. “It made sense that Paarl Wine Route would eventually integrate its operation to further the promotion of “Brand Paarl” within the wine tourism sector. Paarl’s wine producers are looking forward to the increased benefits of the united brand identity and the economies of scale that the combined organisation can deliver.”Trevor Harris, chairman of the Drakenstein Local Tourism Association, agreed that this was an insightful move from the Paarl Wine Route as it will broaden the scope for marketing of the Paarl Wine Valley and that of the bigger Drakenstein area along with Wellington Tourism and Wellington Wine Route.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426440-625x360.jpg" alt="From left to right: Stephen Richardson, Annelize Stroebel, Trevor Harris" width="625" height="360">From left to right: Stephen Richardson, Annelize Stroebel, Trevor HarrisAnnelize Stroebel, general manager of the DLTA, is equally supportive of this decision. “I have always been a strong believer that the wine route and tourism cannot promote the destination independently from each other. This strategic integration will enable us to not only promote the destination more effectively but will also make it possible to provide effective platforms that will create cross-marketing opportunities for our members. I am convinced that this will be mutually beneficial to all parties and contribute to tourism development as a whole in the region.”One of the first campaigns to fall under the new unified structure will be the Paarl OmmiBerg Harvest Celebration, which takes place on Saturday, 3 March 2018.
