Both research evidence producers and users of research evidence such as civil servants are eligible to apply for the award, valued at $4,000. The award will be presented at Evidence 2018, the biennial conference of the AEN, taking place from 25 - 28 September 2018 in Pretoria, South Africa.“I think it’s important that we recognise the men and women who have dedicated themselves to using evidence to address the challenges in Africa,” says Prof Ruth Stewart, chairperson of the Africa Evidence Network (AEN). Government officials, civil society, and researchers – among others – dedicated to using research evidence when making decisions are all eligible to apply for the award. “There is a lot of good work being done by Africans for Africa and our hope is not only to celebrate those who are giving back but to also encourage the spirit of Ubuntu in others. We need to acknowledge the innovative leadership in evidence-informed decision-making happening in Africa and showcase it to the world,” explains AEN senior manager Siziwe Ngcwabe.The award money will enable the winner to attend international events to raise their profile and the profile of Africa in this field. The award is provided as a travel bursary rather than a direct monetary prize and will be administered through the AEN secretariat, which will coordinate with and pay event organisers directly.
