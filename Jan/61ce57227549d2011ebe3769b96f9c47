Seven lucky beachgoers each received one thousand rand in Capitec vouchers with the Capitec Live Better Summer Tour sand castle competition. Following the sand castle competition, fun-seekers were able to get physical at the Coca-Cola and Algoa FM Summer Beach Roadshow. Winners were rewarded with Coca-Cola novelty items. Listeners were kept informed of all the on-the-ground action with live crossings that delivered all the details of the entertainment, activities and giveaways on offer. “The feedback we received is that the crossings helped add to the holiday vibe in the Eastern Cape,” says Damons.
