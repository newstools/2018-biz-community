Companies with 21 or more employees pay the standard entry fee; smaller shops with from two to 20 employees get a discount on entries (amount varies by discipline) and freelance creatives and one-person shops are eligible for an even greater reduction in their entry fee.The new tiered pricing structure helps level the playing field and makes it easier for smaller studios and independent designers, photographers, illustrators and typographers to get their work judged by an all-star creative jury and elevated on a global stage. It also reflects The One Club’s mission to support and celebrate the success of the entire global creative community regardless of company size or location.ADC Annual Awards juries focus on craft, design and innovation, while juries for The One Club for Creativity’s One Show Awards judge work based on creativity of ideas and quality of execution.Judging takes place in March, with finalists announced in April in lead up to the ADC 97th Annual Awards Ceremony on 7 May 7 2018 as part of Creative Week in New York.For more information about the ADC 97th Annual Awards, please visit http://www.adcawards.org.
