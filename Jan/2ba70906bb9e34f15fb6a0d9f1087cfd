In her most recent post as Head of Insight for the Group, she was responsible for delivering locally relevant strategies and campaigns across a number of iconic South African brands, including Nando’s, Bakers and Five Roses. She also played a key role in the agency’s recent wins of Lexus and Windhoek. “I have been so inspired by the agency’s growth – from start-up to a powerful force within the industry. In my new role, I look forward to continuing to grow our clients’ business, working alongside the agency partners and to mentoring young talent – driving the transformation agenda which is critical for our industry,” says Maja-Rasethaba. As a member of the Johannesburg agency’s talented and experienced partnership team, Makosha will be working alongside managing director Alan Bell, executive creative director Adam Weber and Johannesburg chairman Jerry Mpufane to drive to agency’s ambitions. “M&C Saatchi Abel has an enviable reputation as one of the most strategic in the industry – and this is due largely to the efforts of Makosha and her team, something I have been pleased to witness in action since joining the agency a year ago,” says Bell. Robert Grace, founding partner and head of strategy for the M&C Saatchi Abel Group agrees that Makosha’s skills are crucial to the agency’s success. “At the heart of every powerful brand or idea sits a clear and relevant insight. Makosha’s breadth of experience and ability to not only uncover the richest possible insight, but also ensure it comes to life in the resulting work, is invaluable in delivering on our purpose of creating beautifully simple solutions in the increasingly complex and fragmented world of communications.” Makosha takes over the position from Diana Springer, who will soon be launching Black & White, a strategic marketing consultancy within the M&C Saatchi Group. “An appointment like this is hugely rewarding for us as an agency. It is testament to our ability to nurture, grow and retain exceptional talent, and proof that we have the right people to deliver the much-needed diversity of thought that delivers meaningful work.” Says Jerry Mpufane.
