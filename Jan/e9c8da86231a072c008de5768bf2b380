New ‘sharing’ business models could have as much of an impact on the sector as new technology. And the industry’s current customers and suppliers may end up being the biggest new entrants.The PWC report further states that ‘sharing’ is big in the logistics sector now: "From Uber-style business models to last-mile delivery, to more formal joint ventures and partnerships at corporate level, the whole sector is redefining collaboration." A quick search for some of the noteworthy logistics startups that arrived on the scene recently paints a picture of what we can expect going into 2018, with technology changing practically every aspect of logistics, collaboration clearly being key, and innovation leading the way:Drivers NG: A transport-tech company, with a focus on training, verifying, and outsourcing the best drivers to individuals and organisations, Drivers NG engages in recruiting, vetting, and training drivers to meet a variety of needs that clients may have such as corporate drivers, personal drivers, sales van drivers, truck drivers, drivers for Uber, etc.Pargo: Pargo is addressing last mile delivery challenges in South Africa by allowing users to send and receive parcels at dedicated pickup points throughout the country.
