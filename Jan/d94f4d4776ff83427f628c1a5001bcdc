It’s January or, as Twitter calls it, #JanuWorry – a popular South African meme that makes light of the financial quagmire most of us currently find ourselves in. From social media to popular talk shows, #JanuWorry has trended consistently all month. After all, humour is always the best way to get through trying times. As we crawl towards payday, and with the ‘end in sight’, what better way to express our JanuWorry fatigue than through comedy and dance?<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426566.jpg" alt="Breaking Ballet No. 06" width="475" height="297" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426573.jpg" alt="Breaking Ballet No. 06" width="475" height="297" rel="">click to enlargeThe latest instalment of Breaking Ballet features a solo performance by dancer Mahlatse Sachane, in a small South African supermarket. Iain MacDonald, artistic director of Joburg Ballet, describes how the choreography drives the story, “As our hero passes items he can’t currently afford – chocolates, soft drinks, Dagwood sandwiches – his mood grows ever more sombre. It’s forbidden love in the supermarket aisle, dramatic and tragically tongue in cheek!”Breaking Ballet is a partnership between Joburg Ballet and TBWA\ Hunt Lascaris, which taps into the big, trending stories and conversations within popular culture. By making ballet and dance a part of that mix, the company is able to showcase its creativity in new ways – to create punchy, dynamic and locally relevant work that deals with a wide range of current topics.TBWA\ Hunt Lascaris chief creative officer, Peter Khoury, explains the creative concept around Episode 6. “In one way or another, we all experience the JanuWorry pinch. While this dance features a single character’s story, it is also a metaphor for the ‘pain’ we all go through in those last, seemingly never-ending days of the month. The comedy lies in the tension between the dramatic choreography and score, and the rather mundane storyline and location.”Breaking Ballet is an ongoing series of bite-size ballets inspired by today’s big stories. The films live exclusively on social media, on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Joburg Ballet and TBWA\ Hunt Lascaris work with different directors from Darling Films, to give each episode its own unique aesthetic and feel.Follow Joburg Ballet on social media or visit joburgballet.com to catch the rest of the series, and to learn more about their upcoming production of Carmen, on stage at Joburg Theatre from 6 – 15 April.
