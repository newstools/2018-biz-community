From their first day in class, we prepare our students to face the real world of work. Since the students are registered as members of a professional body early in their first year, they inherit a sense of responsibility and pride.”“The Thandulwazi Saturday school has done sterling work since it started,” said Lynn Duke, director of Academics at the Growth Institute. “We are proud to give the Class of 2017 opportunities that they deserve. Our required pass mark on our programs is 60%. This means that industry can trust the calibre of student that passes our programmes.”Thandulwazi Saturday SchoolInitiated in 1991 at St Stithians Boys’ College, with only a handful of students from local township schools, over the last 12 years the Thandulwazi Saturday School has grown enormously in its impact and reach.
