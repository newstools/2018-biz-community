In 2015, starting with the Sauvignon Blanc, they decided to improve their grape sources for the range and concluding with the Chardonnay in 2017, that vineyard voyage is now complete. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425361-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Waterkloof Winemaker Nadia Barnard with estate owner Paul Boutinot (Image Supplied)" width="625" height="325">Waterkloof Winemaker Nadia Barnard with estate owner Paul Boutinot (Image Supplied)“We felt that now was the perfect time to give those grapes the vessels they deserve. Striking new labels that tell their unique stories,” shares cellarmaster for both brands Nadia Barnard.“If we do in fact use grapes from old coastal vineyards, ferment them spontaneously with wild yeast and then age the wine in large wooden casks, why weren’t we tying our flag to the mast and communicating those facts on the labels?”Grammy-nominated graphic artist and renowned illustrator Stanley Chow was commissioned to draw a descriptive icon for each of the six wines, to give each their own identity and striking new look.“It’s all in the name.
