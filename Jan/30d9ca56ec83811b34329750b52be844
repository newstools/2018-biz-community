The summit, which is in association with Pernod Ricard and the Financial Times, will address the theme, "Tectonic Luxury - Changing Dynamics in African Luxury & Wealth". An exclusive Champagne Reception will be hosted by Perrier-Jouët at The Stack Members Club, one of the city’s leading private clubs. Founder of the summit Silvana Bottega noted, “The original and first forum to bring together leaders in this space, the summit provides a unique opportunity to engage with other luxury brand leaders as well as the chance to broaden and deepen your knowledge of Southern Africa luxury landscape.” Join leaders in property, fashion, wine and spirits, wealth management, automotive, luxury branding, beauty, leather and art for what promises to be a highly informative and interesting day’s conference.
