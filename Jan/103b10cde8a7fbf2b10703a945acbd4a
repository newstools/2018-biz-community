We are in the process of making the risky industry safer," he said.He said the informal industry just like others may have a few rogue elements but to condemn it wholly especially in a country that suffers from chronic unemployment is uncalled for.He said the sector has provided job opportunities for approximately five million dependents who rely on the over 1.2 million riders in Kenya."We have members who are graduates, with Masters degree, because they have no jobs. We have members who work hard to feed their families and they have no time to engage in petty criminal activities," he said.With the rising cases of boda-boda riders burning buses and taking the law into their hands, the association has already introduced a database that will have information of all the riders, and area of operation to make it easy for accountability."They have not been getting justice from the police which has made them take the law into their hands. We are encouraging the members to report the cases of accidents so that the riders don't have to take laws into their hands," he said.Read the original article on Capital FM.
