23 January 2018 saw the launch of Superunion, a next-generation global brand agency, offering clients access to a wider, more connected range of strategic and creative services. The new agency will be led by Global CEO Jim Prior and Simon Bolton as Executive Chairman, with Mathew Weiss taking on the role of Managing Director Africa. Superunion has a network of 750 people, with 24 offices in 18 countries, and client billings in excess of $100 million worldwide; its global clients include FIFA, Ford, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Vodafone. Superunion works across Africa, in Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia with brands including Standard Bank, Vodacom, AB InBev, KCB, MMI and Tiger Brands. It is designed to answer the needs of clients today by enabling them to engage with a wider array of specialists, provide a more connected set of services, and will make strategic, creative and client-focused excellence accessible at scale. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/426570.jpg" alt="Mathew Weiss, MD" width="200" height="300">Mathew Weiss, MDAs announced in September 2017, the new agency brings together the expertise of five WPP agencies: Brand Union's strategic strength and global influence, The Partners' award-winning creative excellence, Lambie-Nairn's unparalleled history in identity and motion graphics, Addison's unique understanding of corporate audiences, content development and digital delivery and the premium packaging offer of VBAT (which will continue to operate under the VBAT name). By combining these five specialist agencies, Superunion is able to work with clients across a broader spectrum of critical audiences than its competitors. These include corporate, consumer, customer and talent, and together provide a more complete view of the role of brand in driving strategic advantage for clients. Superunion has more senior-level, strategic and creative leaders who will help organisations rethink how their most ambitious goals can be achieved, applying upstream creativity to the heart of business not just its outward expression. Mathew Weiss, Superunion’s Managing Director, said: “Superunion will be a first of its kind in Africa, a new type of branding agency that is designed to help clients unite an ever-expanding list of stakeholders around a singular brand vision. We will have 50 strategic and creative thinkers working together with our clients to deliver upstream creative solutions to their most challenging brand challenges.” Continues Mathew: “The recent integration of Doug de Villiers and key members of the Brand Science team (formally Interbrand Africa) into Superunion further strengthens our capabilities on the continent. This new business gives our clients access to Superunion’s global resources and Brand Science’s deep strategic expertise and strong relationships in Africa." Jim Prior, Global CEO at Superunion, said: “The world needs creative solutions to stimulate growth, in a way that traditional approaches alone cannot achieve, which is why we have formed Superunion. That creativity has to be applied at the centre of the business, where it can affect things like innovation, product and service, recruitment and retention, culture change, people’s experience of the brand, and the driving purpose of the organisation. We will offer more integrated services, high-level strategic relevance and closer connections to audiences, building stronger brands that drive our clients’ success.” Simon Bolton, Executive Chairman at Superunion, said: “We want our clients and their brands to build great, mutually beneficial relationships with their customers, various stakeholders and society at large. While it’s a big goal, we believe it gives them a much bigger chance of long-term success. Using our core principle of creative optimism and bringing the power of creativity to organisations, we are creating union that drives business growth.” For further information please contact: Mathew Weiss, Managing DirectorMathew.weiss@brandunion.combRev('brev-2b71fad8-43e2-4576-9140-9bb35c284aaa', '>a/\<moc.noinudnarb@ssiew.wehtaM>"moc.noinudnarb;46#&ssiew.wehtaM:otliam"=ferh a<')073 890 5436About Superunion: Superunion is a next-generation brand agency.
