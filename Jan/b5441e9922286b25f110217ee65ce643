While there are many incubation options available, such as CiTi’s own VeloCiTi programmes, what happens when entrepreneurs finish the programme?” CiTi said.“Entrepreneurs facing the complexities of growth can hugely benefit from ongoing advice and contacts from those who understand the journey. Who better to support an entrepreneur than other entrepreneurs?”Hence CiTi Circles, with forums led and facilitated by Mignon Keyser, a peer facilitator with 15 years experience, who has worked with CiTi and entrepreneurs in its ecosystem for many years. Each session aims to provide a safe, contained space for entrepreneurs to ask questions and get advice without judgment.This article was originally published on www.disrupt-africa.com
