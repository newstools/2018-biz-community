In just 10 days it has reached more than 670 million people all over the world – a prime example of the power of the internet and social media. And one of the most successful destination marketing campaigns for Namibia since independence in 1990. After Trump’s derogative remark on Haiti and African countries, the Namibian tourism company Gondwana Collection roped in local producer and artist EES to make a video clip on the most beautiful “shithole” country in Africa. Stunning pictures of animals and scenery show Namibia at its best. A Trump voice imitator is used for the narration.<img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1801/425230-120x120.jpg?2" alt="via Flickr (CC BY 2.0)" width="120" height="120">World stands up for Haiti, Africa after Trump's "shithole" commentUS President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to respond to reports that he referred to Africa, Haiti and El Salvador as "shitholes"...By Andy Walker 15 Jan 2018The Norwegian company Meltwater, which monitors and analyses Gondwana’s online presence, congratulated it with the words: “Amazing to see that the video picked up 1140 global editorial articles”. They were seen by 662 million people in 45 countries and in nine different languages. This was in addition to 13 million users of social media.“Let’s hope that our video makes the global public see the beautiful sides of Africa”, said Manni Goldbeck, brand and marketing director of the Gondwana Collection. “Namibia is politically stable. Its cultural diversity, unique fauna and flora and breath-taking landscapes, together with one of the most progressive environmental legislations in the world, make Namibia a top travel destination.” The Gondwana Collection Namibia combines its hospitality business with nature conservation and social commitment in a sustainable manner. The company today includes four private nature parks and 18 quality accommodation offerings across Namibia’s key tourist attractions. Nature conservation is financed with the proceeds from the eco-friendly hospitality business, which in turn creates jobs and career opportunities.
