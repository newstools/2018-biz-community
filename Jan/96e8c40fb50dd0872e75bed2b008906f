Simply put, my role entails bringing to life Google’s mission to organise and democratise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful so that we can grow our users and partners and so that our users and partners can grow. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list? My priorities are to learn (and where relevant unlearn) from the Google Africa team, and around the world. If I’m going to achieve my overall goal I need to immerse myself in who and what Google is, how it works, what its products are and how they work. For me, the most important element is going to be listening to and observing our users to gain insights into what we do well and where we can better meet their needs. I also plan to meet our partners and learn and grow from and with them. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you hope to achieve there? Any short-term/long-term goals? Or what are you most looking forward to? I’m very much looking forward to bringing Google’s mission and vision to life.

To quote Thabo Mbeki, “I am an African and something new always comes out of Africa.” I believe Steve Biko’s prophecy that “Africa will give the world an even more humane face.” I also believe in Thabo Mbeki, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Thomas Sankara, Robert Sobukwe and Patrice Lumumba when they spoke about the regeneration of Africa and the African Renaissance saying that the time has come and a new and unique civilisation is soon to be added to the world. Africa desires a change – Pixley argued that Africa already recognises his/her anomalous position and desires a change..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on your previous experience and how it has equipped you for your new position. I’ve been very lucky and blessed that my career has spanned many parts of the continent and multiple marketing disciplines, from market research, data analytics, consumer and market insights to media, brand management, sponsorship, 360 campaign launches… you name it.The critical skill for any marketer is having an understanding of, and insight into, the consumers his/her brand serves, and an attitude that is consumer-centric. These are the critical skills I bring to this role. Having worked at Unilever, Nike and Vodacom has given me exposure to a fair balance of art (by way of big ideas), science (measurement and metrics) and the revenue aspects of the job. <img src="http://c.biz-file.com/c/1707/402388-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Abey Mokgwatsane, new managing executive for brand and communications at Vodacom" width="120" height="120">Abey Mokgwatsane on what's next after Ogilvy SAAbey Mokgwatsane talks about the legacy he leaves behind at Ogilvy & Mather SA and what his new role as Vodacom's managing executive for brand and communications entails...By Juanita Pienaar 19 Jul 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in marketing?
