Irene Muloni, Minister of Energy and Mineral Development for Uganda, and H.E. Dr. Frehiwot Wodehanna, State Minister of Electricity, Ethiopia, will be in attendance.The East Africa Energy and Infrastructure Summit will bring together regional governments from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia, leading utility and regulatory companies from across the region, as well as international financiers, donor organisations and power developers, to discuss the most significant energy and infrastructure projects being developed across the region and to explore practical solutions geared at increasing investor appetite in East Africa.EnergyNet’s Anna Gorzkowska commented: “We have seen that the energy landscape in East Africa is evolving and diversifying. From the development of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline and Refinery Project, to the large renewable energy projects such as the Bujagali Hydropower Project and Lake Turkana Wind Power Project – there has never been a more exciting time for the East African region, and we’re delighted to have got the timing of this meeting right. There is so much interest not only in the larger infrastructure and energy projects, but also in the ever-developing off grid space.”The East Africa summit will be co-located with the second annual Africa Energy Forum: Off The Grid (AEF:OTG). AEF:OTG will focus on the topical issues concerning rolling out off-grid projects across Africa, presenting current project opportunities and building on the outcomes of the first successful off grid Summit, held in Dar es Salaam in December 2016.Participating at both meetings are the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development for Uganda, UMEME, the Energy Regulatory Authority and the Rural Electrification Agency. Power Africa, ENGIE, Fieldstone Africa, METKA, Nedbank, Shell New Energies, Wartsila, Nocart, Windlab  and the African Trade Insurance Agency have all confirmed their full support and sponsorship of the forums, demonstrating their central role in shaping the East African region’s power and infrastructure sectors and the continent’s off-grid sector.Summit details:Meeting dates: 6-8 February 2018Venue: Kampala Serena HotelWebsite: www.East-Africa-Summit.com and www.AEF-OffGrid.com
